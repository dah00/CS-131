If you are looking for something to stimulate your brain, this isn't it.  However, if you are just looking for a good laugh, you'll enjoy The Bad Girl's Guide.  It's funny and light, and definitely a good way to pass a little bit of time.
It's nice to have a cheeky-style self-help book.  Tuttle's irreverence is refreshing and a couple of her lines made me laugh.  Nonetheless, it's forgettable nonsense and at $14, a tad too expensive for what is offered the reader.
This book is the perfect summer read - light, funny, entertaining, sometimes inspiring.  You can pick it up at any point in the book and begin reading, forget about marking your page, it's not that kind of book.   <br /> <br />I can't wait to read Cameron Tuttle's other Bad Girl books - Viva la Bad Girl!
I adored this book! I passed it around to all of my friends and the all enjoyed it immensely. Great writing, very funny. Worth my time,  worth yours.
I wasn't expecting &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, just a few laughs.    I was very disappointed.    It wasn't funny at all.    Keep your money, but if you really want to buy it, buy mine.

I aded this book! I passed  around to all of my friends  the all enjoyed  immensely Great wrg very funny Wth my time  wth yours
I wasn't expectg &quotCatcher  the Rye&quot just a few laughs    I was very disappoted    It wasn't funny at all    Keep your money but  you really want to buy  buy me
A great book that shows how serious le doesn't have to be Yes some of the ideas are a ltle out there but they show that thgs sometimes aren't as stressful as we make them to be Thgs that are covered are how to lose a looser how to sce me free drks fms of alternative datg  much me All the advice is very fun  very wty This book is not f the ultra conservative serious  uptight Is f the person who likes to laugh  thk about ways to get whatever you want Even  these are not logical ways the seed is planted I have to adm I've sced many free drks from her great  pracical methods!
TWICE  the whole book It is a cute book but not really funny n usefull  anywayunless your 18 then you might get away wh some of the stunts  here I thk I found 3 fairly good tips other than that I was done wh the book  under an hour  can't wa to get rid of 
I bought this book after seeg a review  a magaze  I didn't put  down until I'd fished  The auth offers a fresh perspective  crazy tips on how to be the best  badest girl I cried from laughter  then went out  bought 3 copies to give to my best female friends Another book that I found tense was &quotHe Never Called Aga&quot Now after readg the other book I could really enjoy &quotThe Bad Girl's Guide&quot Yes!
This book was credibly spontaneous It makes you laugh like crazy  you can actually take most of the advice given No the advice isn't spirual  what  takes to be a woman 's just a lot of fun   helps you brg the goodness  childhood out of you You responsibly decide what advice you'd prefer to take [though A LOT tend to be very jokeful  not actually serious] It's a cute book you can read  you just need a getaway from actually beg responsible  serious 24/7
Belleluv had  right Hilarious  you get  enjoy Cameron Tuttle's sense of hum This book never fails to make me laugh<BR>Just the chapter on beg bad at wk alone is wth s price<BR>Just thkg of dog some of these thgs to my boss makes the stress melt away<BR>Every girl whether she acts on   not Can be a &quotbad girl&quot at heart  celebrate the power of beg Baaaaad!
