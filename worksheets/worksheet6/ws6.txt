US	34311599	R210TNEWFRGI6L	1576734587	12194163	On Becoming Baby Wise	Books	1	10	24	N	N	Read the book from cover to cover - still appalled!	Why would anyone take breastfeeding advice from a man who is not even a parent or medically trained for that matter? Think about this people- would you ask your mechanic to deliever your baby or to set your broken arm? To listen to someone with no medical experience is insane. I have 3 children- a singleton and twins - all FORMULA FED and they started sleeping on their own, all through the night- within 2 weeks of birth- WITHOUT THIS BOOK! This book endorses torturing infants. Babies are not born with conscious thoughts of selfishness as Mr.Ezzo is trying to say- They cry because they are hungry! For Goodness sakes- Feed your babies when they are hungry and before taking any buffoons parenting advise- please consult your pediatrican. A good point is to remember that people are not always scheduled- most adults are not- how can you attempt to program a child when to be? It would not be fair to do this to your baby. Please try another book- \\"what to expect when your expecting\\" and \\"What to expect the first year.\\" is excellent and unbiased.	2005-08-31
US	12784370	R1B29F3ZO82ER1	1576734587	12194163	On Becoming Baby Wise	Books	1	8	22	N	N	Yikes!!!	Another bad baby book that promotes emotional DETATCHMENT.This book is a danger to children everywhere.Dr ezzo claims that babies do not remember being left to cry.Hogwash,I remember clearly and have been deeply traumatised for life.I now suffer from permanent sleep disorders and fear of the dark as well as a lack of emotional attatchment to my parents.I read this book purely out of curiosity.I was stunned at the coldness of this so-called christian man.My babies were rocked to sleep then laid down beside me right where God intended for babies to be.My children go to sleep easily without issue,in fact they were sleeping through the night by 2 weeks of age.Co-sleeping is the only healthy means of raising children.This book is a throwback to the cold harsh victorian era where selfish parents put themselves first and focused on training children like they are wild animals.I pity any child who is put through the riggors of this horrible book.Avoid this book like the plague.	2005-08-20

Why would anyone take breastfeeding advice from a man who is not even a parent or medically trained for that matter? Think about this people- would you ask your mechanic to deliever your baby or to set your broken arm? To listen to someone with no medical experience is insane. I have 3 children- a singleton and twins - all FORMULA FED and they started sleeping on their own, all through the night- within 2 weeks of birth- WITHOUT THIS BOOK! This book endorses torturing infants. Babies are not born with conscious thoughts of selfishness as Mr.Ezzo is trying to say- They cry because they are hungry! For Goodness sakes- Feed your babies when they are hungry and before taking any buffoons parenting advise- please consult your pediatrican. A good point is to remember that people are not always scheduled- most adults are not- how can you attempt to program a child when to be? It would not be fair to do this to your baby. Please try another book- \\"what to expect when your expecting\\" and \\"What to expect the first year.\\" is excellent and unbiased.	2005-08-31	4

Often people defend Gary Ezzo's parenting materials with \\"The materials are great! As long as you use common sense and don't follow the books legalistically. . .\\" The assumption is that there is no inherent problem with Babywise, just in parents not using common sense.<br /><br />Two friends sent me Gary Ezzo's \\"Babywise\\" when I was expecting our first. It was interesting, a bit strange--nothing like the other books I had read about infant parenting. But the way in which it was written was persuasive and I found myself skimming over it again. Then the \\"Preparation for Parenting\\" classes were offered at our church.<br /><br />In the end, we implemented the PDF routine--with flexibility and encouragement from \\"Contact Moms.\\"<br /><br />My son seemed to do great on it at first--but my son went from a hefty 16 lbs at 3.5 months to 14 lb 2 oz at 6 months. He is one of the many BW babies who is either diagnosed \\"Failure to Thrive\\" or has undiagnosed low weight gain.<br /><br />Later I found out that milk supply loss and slowed weight gain is normal within families that implement Babywise. Why? Because it goes against how breastfeeding works, chemically, hormonally and physiologically. And Babywise if full of other *medical* errors, that parents tend to overlook because of how persuasive Gary Ezzo can write.<br /><br />If you are interested in the full story of our experience with Babywise, google \\"Confessions of a Failed Babywiser\\".<br /><br />If you insist upon using Babywise--please be sure to buy the most recent (2001) edition, rather than the 1995 edition that this review is posted under.

I have a 15 1/2 month old son who has been sleeping through the night since he was 9 WEEKS old, thanks to this book.  Schedules are very obviously a GREAT thing for babies b/c they always know what to expect and thus become happy and well adjusted babies.  My son is happy, go lucky and has great sleeping habits.  I plan to utilize the tools with my son, Jakob, who is due in July 2005, as well!!!! <br /> <br />I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK 200% FOR ANY NEW MOTHER.  I would just say that it may be a better idea to begin the scheduling after about 2-3 weeks of age b/c babies need to adjust to being outside the womb first before being comfortable starting a schedule.  You'll see, it's a great guide!!!!! <br />Melissa	2005-03-04	4

I have sat here and read all the glowing reviews for this book, and the one thing they seem to have in common is \\"my baby slept through the night EARLY!!!\\"    <br /> <br />But is this a good goal?  Who does this benefit?  According to infant specialists, not the baby.   Babies are meant to wake up at regular intervals for the first several months.  This has several purposes, one is to eat... especially for a breastfed infant.  Breastmilk is digested very rapidly, and infants require REGULAR feedings to fuel their rapid growth at this stage.  Why should they be expected NOT to eat for long periods of time at night when the rest of the day they are eating every 2 hours or so?  An infant can get up to 1/3 of their total nutrition in night feedings.  Are they supposed to make up for this during the day?  And with the Babywise feeding schedule and the \\"no snacking rule\\", where are these extra feedings going to come from?  You are in effect taking away at least one of your infants MEALS... and to what purpose?  So mom and dad can sleep longer?  <br /> <br />Another problem with \\"sleeping through the night\\" is that it puts the infant at an increased risk for SIDS.  Infants who sleep for long periods of time often have trouble rousing themselves from deep sleep, which has been found to be a factor in SIDS deaths. <br /> <br />The sleep training method outlined in this book can result in a great deal of crying before the infant \\"gets the idea\\".  Infant crying for extended periods has been shown to cause brain trauma due to the release of stress chemicals that can actually cause lesions in the brain tissue.  Far from being \\"normal\\" for infants to cry for extended periods, it CAN cause permenant damage emotionally and physically.  Even actual infant sleep experts (such as Ferber) do not recommend any form of \\"sleep training\\" before SIX MONTHS of age,(not six WEEKS as described in this book) and then only for infants with actualy sleep disorders, NOT for a normal child. <br /><br />The fact is, sleeping through the night is NOT an important goal for an infant. The promise of having a child \\"sleeping through\\" at a young age is only a benefit to the PARENT, and poses a health risk to the child. <br /> <br />For more information about the author, check out [...]	2005-02-19	4

I tell my friends who are expecting that one of the greatest gifts I have given my children is teaching them to sleep (refreshed-ready to learn, laugh and play). My three sons slept through the night by eight weeks (and still do) and seemed to truly enjoy their nap times. My youngest is four months old. He wakes up from his nap or night time sleep by cooing. I go into his room and am greeted by a large toothless grin. He is a very happy and pleasant baby. He was over 9 lbs at birth and is nearly 18lbs now. He has a beautiful complextion, bright eyes and a quick smile. <br />I am not writing this to defend myself against the crazed rantings of some of the other reviewers. (I would have been okay if they'd simply disagreed with the book, but to imply that those who use the book are heartless child abusers is way over the top) I am writing it to let expectant parents and those who struggle with children who won't sleep know that I have used this book and applied its principles (with love and patience not cold-hearted cruelty) for all three of my children and have had excellent results.	2005-01-19	4

Do any internet search on Gary Ezzo and you will find horror stories of poor babies that have been PYHSICALLY harmed by these methods. The American Academy of Pediactrics are against these methods. <br /> <br />I have been practicing attachment parenting (the complete opposite of Babywise) for my baby. He sleeps with me every night, I feed him when he is hungry, not at a scheduled time, and I pick him up when he is crying. <br /> <br />He started sleeping 6 hours at night when he was 2 weeks old! By the time he was 8 weeks old, he slept the entire night only waking for one feeding. By 12 weeks, he was sleeping through the night with no waking. Now at 7 months he still sleeps through the night (8:30pm - 7:30am). Everyone comments on what a good baby he is and he is so happy. He has smiles and giggles for everyone! <br /> <br />Please, please, please, do a little research on these methods and think very long about how you want your baby to grow up, trusting his parents to take care of him, or wailing away in a crib wondering why Mommy and Daddy don't love him enough to FEED HIM WHEN HE IS HUNGRY. <br />	2004-12-18	4

This \\"good\\" baby, seemingly so \\"well-disciplined,\\" is at risk for becoming a withdrawn child and an internally angry, depressed adult. Other disconnected infants cry harder when they receive no response, becoming obnoxious and openly angry. These babies become children who are very hard to manage.

He would rather you manipulate and force your child into a sleeping schedule by depraving her food and comfort, the two most important things a child needs to grow.

Therefore withholding meals until the parent is ready to feed the children, or punishing them by crib isolation when they do not want or eat when the parent is ready is part of his theory.

So many doctors, teachers, parents condone this book because these methods are wrong. Yes a routine can help create a more secure child, but so do comfort, love and nutrition! A child under 3 months cannot and should not be forced into a schedule! Those are the MOST critical months and can be the most damaging. There are HUNDREDS OF REAL cases of FTT (failure to thrive) dehydration, weight loss and damaging mental effects of waking a sleeping baby and not feeding on demand just to get them on a schedule because of these books. Gary Ezzo who does not even have credentials in child development, healthcare, breastfeeding, or baby care, nor does he have an undergraduate degree. His book is not endorsed by ANY pediatric counsel and is discouraged by many doctors, associations, teachers and even followers of his faith. I'm sure there are people who praise this book as made obvious by the reviews, but research both sides of the spectrum before you buy it <br />[...] <br />	2004-09-17	4

But at what price did that little bundle have to pay? Just you want and see. You were so concerned with getting your child to sleep through the night that you read this book and praticed what it preached. You manipulated and forced your child into a schedule by depraving her of the two things it depends on THE MOST; COMFORT and FOOD. And yes it worked. There were other ways to do it, but you used a method that would be deemed as inhumane if you did it to an adult or even a dog. But see how your child develops EMOTIONALLY AND MENTALLY becuase of it and then maybe you will realize what so many doctors, teachers, parenrs are trying to expose. These methods are wrong. Yes a routine can help create a more secure child, but so does comfort, love and nutition! A child under 3 months cannot and should not be forced into a routine! Those are the MOST critical months and can be the most damaging. His book is not endorsed by ANY pediatric counsel and is discouraged by many doctors, associations, teachers and even followers of his faith. So go ahead follow his principal and don't feed your infant on demand just let her cry and do not console her - sure she'll eventually stop and you may think you have disciplined her. But what you have taught her instead is that no one is coming to comfort her and therefore she has given up hope. Something that WILL effect her in future realtionships. There are HUNDREDS OF REAL cases of FTT (failure to thrive) dehydration, weight loss and damaging mental effects of waking a sleeping baby and not feeding on demand just to get them on a schedule. And waking a sleeping infant under 3 months something that you should never ever do - ASK ANY DOCTOR. It effects their mental growth! Babies grow when SLEEP! Thats' how their little brains develop! They need to eat on demand for the first three months of life, there little bodieshit so many growth spurts during that time that the need food to fuel it! You are just depriving them of NUTRITION needed to grow! You can create comfortable \\"routines\\" when the are old enough to actually understand mentally what a routine is, not before. But don't take my word for it, follow the preachings of Ezzo who does not even have credentials in child development, healthcare, breastfeeding, or baby care, nor does he have an undergraduate degree. So hurray for you that your baby sleeps through the night, there were other ways to do it - but if you enforced such practices as outlined in his book, see what emotional and mental ramifications will come of it in the end. <br />[...]	2004-09-17	4

It walks you through how to get your child to eat &amp; sleep through the night.  By eight weeks our baby slept through the night!  She is a good sleeper, napper, eater.  Thus is well-rested and so are we.  She has never had digestive problems, learns in her parent/infant class -- all which I attribute to this program.  Everyone, who has not used Babywise, has commented on how well adjusted our baby is.  My friends that have used Babywise just respond with an &quot;I told you so&quot; as their children are equally well-adjusted.  Many friends with multiples have used this program successfully.  Forget Sears and some of those other child experts. Our nephew was raised via Dr. Sears and at 3 years has never slept through the night, still sleeps with his parents and is a very whiny, codependent child.	2004-04-22	4

I do believe there are multiple ways to raise an infant/ toddler- but I think we can all agree, as parents, that a routine is the most important established step in raising a healthy child. After 8 weeks of child demand feeding,as recommended by every lactation specialist I spoke with, resulting in 2-3 hours of colicky behavior a day, feeding schedules that mimicked once an hour feedings in the morning and at night, I realized that proper feeding techniques are essential. I had an excellent latcher- and a wonderful &quot;snacker&quot; on my hands-but not a baby who knew how to eat efficiently. Volume wasn't a problem- if I didn't mind feeding him 12 times a day, with no more than 3 hours of sleep at a time at night at 8 weeks. I just felt as a mother that by 2 months, babies should be sleeping more along the lines of 4-5 hour stretches by then. That is when my PEDIATRICIAN recommended this book by Gary Ezzo- and within 72 hours of starting the schedule at 8 weeks of age- my baby was sleeping 7 hours through the night. WHAT A GODSEND!. My baby is happy, thriving, growing immensely, and frankly has absolutely no fussy periods in the day at all. Even his bowel movements are more regular, less gassy, and he wets 8-10 diapers a day so hydration is not a factor for us. I think we can all agree that different routines work for different babies- and as mother's we have to try on many different &quot;routine hats&quot; to find what works for our own children. But to irately state that this is &quot; child abuse &quot;, by one reviewer, is offensive to the mother's out there whose babies do well with this schedule. I highly recommend this book and schedule to any mother willing to try something new if what they have isn't working. At 12 weeks- I have a bright, happy, energetic and beautiful 14lb baby- who has doubled his birth weight already, and he has two parents who are rested and ready to meet his energy demand. In fact my nephew is 15 weeks- and not &quot;babywise&quot; and is still only sleeping 4 hours at a time, and while he was bigger by a full pund at birth- he is now a pound down versus his cousin.	2004-04-15	4

I was quite surprised by how much sense the book makes, in light of charges of child abuse.  I followed the main guidelines of this book with my son, also being flexible to his needs (as the book suggests), and he was a well adjusted, well rested, successfully breastfed baby.  Again, I'm not sure where charges of child abuse come in, since the main premise of the book is to help children breastfeed more successfully, to achieve weight gain by nursing on fat and calorie rich hind milk, instead of fore milk, and to sleep better by achieving a regular schedule.  Every parent knows that babies are creatures of habit, and this book helps foster successful habits.  Just as parents don't let their toddlers eat candy all day, or let their six year olds watch tv to their heart's content, this book helps parents of infants set a routine to benefit their development.  Every person I've ever recommended this book to has had great success.  The track record of more infant-centered approaches (let the baby dictate what they want, when they want it)has not been so successful, in my experience.  Rather, this book helps parents anticipate what babies need and when they need it.  Don't listen to inflammatory critics.  Read and judge for yourself.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised, as was I.	2004-03-15	4

I was amazed with the ideas in the book.  Letting a baby cry to sleep and let the baby sleep in its vomit is surely abuse.  My son sleeps 12 hours straight every night and has no problems taking naps, but he never cried to sleep.  The book went to the trash as soon as I was finished reading it.  My son is well adjusted and with patience and routine, he learned to calmly go to bed after our bedtime ritual, a book and a song.  We have the same routine since he was a newborn, he knows we will be by his side if he cries, he knows we love him and because of that, he sleeps peacefully.  New parents be aware that letting your baby cry is not the solution to sleepless nights.  Trust yourselves, not a horrible book.  Love your kids, do not torture them.

Be honest with your pediatrician about your feeding schedule (don't lie b/c you think he/she won't like it), and if your baby isn't gaining weight, looks dehydrated, is extremely fussy or shows any other signs of illness, get your baby to the ER and choose another method.

I was a wreck.  She was bottle fed and did not sleep through the night until she was 3 years old and her baby sister was on the way.  It was horrible finally having to realize that she would have just cry herself to sleep at the age of three.  I had friends whose babies slept perfectly and ate perfectly.  The one thing they all had in common was Babywise.  With a new baby on the way, I vowed to do everything different.  I read Babywise cover to cover several times before my 2nd daughter was born. I nursed her and followed the book as close as I could.  It was amazing. She did everything the book said she would do. She was sleeping from 7pm to 7am by 15 weeks.  Naps were not an issue. She would just go down at the scheduled time.  She is now 5 and we are expecting sister number 3.  I've given away my copy of Babywise, as well as purchased copies for my friends and family.  I am about to buy myself another copy so that I will be refreshed when my new daughter gets her in a few months!	2003-10-27	4

I exclusively breastfed my daughter for a year and she started sleeping through the night at 10 weeks.  At 2 1/2 she continues to sleep through the night and wake up happy.  I owe a lot of it to Babywise. After reading a few books and articles, my husband and I chose to implement the Babywise method. <br />The first few weeks I nursed on demand until breastfeeding was fully established.  Then I eased into a 3 hour feed, wake, and sleep cycle.  Yes, my daughter cried a little but that's what taught me to distinguish her cries.  I never let her too much.  Once the routine was set and she knew what to expect, she rarely cried and she became such a happy baby.  I was also a happy new mom since I could follow the schedule and plan my activities around it.  The book also allows for flexibilty such as unusual situations like plane trips or growth spurts.<br />Now I'm exclusively breastfeeding my 7 week old son and he's on his way to sleeping through the night too.  I'm following the 3 hour cycle and at 5 weeks he slept 5 hours, at 6 weeks 6 hours, and now sleeping 7 hours.<br />I also just finished reading Childwise for my older daughter and plan on implementing Gary Ezzo's theories once again!

We know tons of families who have used this program and we have been able to watch these PDF children grow up to be the most well-behaved baby's/toddlers /and kids I have ever seen.As a former Nanny I have seen first hand parents who demand fed their children, and raised them in a \\"demand\\" sort of way- the majority of these children were whiny, spoiled brats who ran their household. The PDF children I know, who come from a variety of different types of families, are more patient, independent, well mannered and self reliant than any children I have ever seen. Seeing this evidence in these kids made we ask- \\"how did you train your children to be so GOOD all the time??\\" and everyone's answer was it started with Babywise. My husband and I have used the ideas suggested in this book and we have a very happy,well nourished, 3 month old son who sleeps 10 hours a night, is able to entertain himself during playtimes, as well as joyfully interact with us, and puts himself to sleep at naps and bedtime with little to no fussing and no sleep props. I am not saying that this philosophy of parenting is \\"how it SHOULD be done\\"- but in our personal experience and personal witness of other children trained this way, it is worth a read. Contrary to other review's- it does not promote ignoring your child or denying him what he needs, but teaches you to recognize his needs more accurately, in order to be a better parent. I love the fact that this author writes about welcoming your child into the family unit- and not centering the family unit around your child. Which happens all to often with Demand Parenting- baby calls the shots. babywise teaches moms and dads to train the children to be a part of the family, and not to revolve the family around the child. I love my son and am overwhelmed by the blessing that he is, and he is a humongous part of my life now, but he is not my entire life. i Think any mom or dad whois overwhelmed by constant feedings and lack of sleep and a general angst over \\" what am I doing?\\" would greatly benefit from this book.	2003-04-06	4

Do not read it before the baby is born.  It will make no sense.  Also, do not let moms and mothers-in-law read the book.  It will make perfect sense to them as they have forgotten what it is like to survive on minutes of sleep at a time and will frequently ask you if you are \\"following the schedule\\".  The authors are short and to the point which is good because so is your patience after three weeks of round-the-clock feedings.  In fact, you will probably throw Babywise away once or twice because you are sick of their stupid schedules and personal antecdotes but hopefully, like me, you will retrieve the book before trash day.  <BR>    The best advice I picked up from Babywise is that if your baby wakes up crying from a nap then they have not slept long enough.  Peek through the door if you have to but let them work themselves back to sleep.  One of my many mistakes was to run in during naptime and assume that because my baby was crying naptime must be over.  I wish my sister-in-law had not thrown her Babywise book out.  Her child is now ten months and is still waking up twice a night for feedings and comforting. I kicked that habit at 3 months.	2003-03-28	4

I was totally exhausted with my baby's feeding every 2-3 hours and rarely sleeping more than a 2 hour stretch. I knew I needed help and checked out 4 books from the library on baby's and sleep problems. I recommend all of them, and especially On Becoming Babywise. It is truly a common sense approach. The other books that helped me are:<BR>Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child by Marc Weissbluth<BR>Sleeping Through the Night by Jodi Mindell<BR>Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems by Richard Ferber<br />Before I read these books, when I was done nursing and tried to put my baby to sleep afterwards (at night time), he would immediately cry. I would then try to rock him to sleep... and when he was asleep put him in his bed... and he would immediately awaken and cry. I felt I was getting sick physically and also feeling terrible emotionally because I was very sleep deprived. <br />When he was about 10 weeks, I started implementing what I learned in this and the other books. He responded immediately without too much trouble. The hardest part was 2 nights in a row where I had to help him break the habit I had helped him get into of being fed every time he awakened at night. I would just soothe him, or change a diaper, etc. I got up a lot of times those 2 nights. But it paid off. Now when I put my baby to bed, he rarely cries and when he does, just for 5-10 minutes. <br />I weighed him weekly to be sure he was gaining enough weight even though I was no longer feeding every 2-3 hours around the clock.  He is very healthy (even on the chubby side).  I do not feed him when he cries in the middle of the night... I soothe him, but will not feed him unless he has slept 8-9 hours since his last feeding... newborn babies do need to be fed more often than that the first few weeks... be sure to follow the guidelines and not put them on that schedule before those first few critical weeks). He is also very happy... I hear everyday how alert and smiley he is for his age (which I believe is partly his nature, and partly habits which nurture him and help him be his best). <br />Dr. Ezzo's advice for helping your baby get on a schedule were very helpful. He suggests a flexible schedule (contrary to what the negative reviewers of his book say he says). My baby sleeps much better now for both naps and nighttime.<br />I truly don't believe his advice has put any baby in the FTP (failure to thrive) category. Babies need proper rest just like adults, which helps with their overall well being as well as very critical brain development.<br />The alarmists against this book are ignoring the advice of every single one of the authors of the books I read... and choosing to pay attention to only one author whose advice is different and possibly out-of-step with all the others (William Sears). Even the American Association of Pediatrics in Caring for Your Baby and Young Child say \\"Many babies cannot fall asleep without crying, and will go to sleep more quickly if left to cry for a while.\\" I just wish I had known some of this information sooner.<br />I am now much more in tune with my baby's cries and what he needs. He is now part of a family that is more balanced than we were before reading this book. I was questioning if I was cut out for motherhood, but now I feel capable of having 3 or 4 children of my own as well as serving children in the foster parenting programs in my community. This book, and the others are just what new moms like me need since babies don't come with a handbook, and it's really not as easy as \\"mother's natural instincts\\" for most of us. <br />Also, if the claims some of these reviews make are true that Dr. Ezzo has been excommunicated from his church, I believe the claims are suspect. If the claime are at all true, any kind of church controversy would not at all be related to the wonderful parenting advice given in his book.	2003-03-06	4

She is now 18 months old and I can count the number of times she has woken up during the night since week 6 on one hand.<br />There are 2 keys to success with this book, in our minds.  First, follow your instincts.  You need to follow the guidelines the authors set up, but you need to be flexible.  Do not impose the rules with authoritarian rigidity.  Instead, be willing to bend a little (and the authors, in fact, recommend this too).  Second, be consistent.  It might appear during the first several weeks that you are not making progress and your baby is not responding because you do not see any changes.  Don't be discouraged!  Keep at it!  For our daughter, it was like turning on a switch.  One night she was up during the night, the next she was down for 8 hours.  After that occurred twice, she was sleeping through the night.<br />Lastly, the greatest benefit of the guidelines in this book is that they empower parents.  For about the last 16 months, we have known what our baby's needs are because we have a schedule and have followed the guidelines.  We gained confidence as first time parents to make good decisions.  Now, as she has started walking and talking, we feel confident in doing our parenting and she responds well.<br />Parenting isn't easy, but coupling this book with your instincts will likely lead to a happy baby and happy, confident and rested parents.	2002-10-24	4

The one key thing that Ezzo recommends is flexible schedules.  A baby doesn't have a schedule for their first few months, and rather than putting my baby to bed when I felt he should sleep, I put his to bed when he needed it, and it eventually fell into a pattern.  The first few weeks feeding were rough, especially with a baby that has reflux.  But I paid attention to my baby, and learned to figure out why he is crying rather than offering him food every time.  That was the most helpful advice from the book.  Ezzo also talks about different stages that your baby will go through, and that helps as well.  I learned for myself contrary to the book, that if my son fell asleep in the swing, or somewhere else for the first few weeks, it was alright.  The most important thing was that he got the sleep that he needed.  But by his fourth month, he learned that his crib was for sleeping, and things got much better after that.  The point is, go with your gut.   Follow advice that feels right, but if it doesn't, then do what does!	2002-08-29	4
US	36034107	R2BXXSUHYPV8YZ	1576734587	12194163	On Becoming Baby Wise	Books	2	7	11	N	N	So-so advice	I read this book because it was recommended to me by several people, and was not impressed by Ezzo's advice.  <br />When my daughter was about a month old, she was reluctant to fall asleep during the daytime, especially without what Ezzo labels as \\"crutches,\\" like using a swing or a pacifier, and being a first-time mom, I thought she needed to be having regulated naps, which is something Ezzo advocates.  <br />I gave his methods a try and wound up with a week's worth of scream-filled naptimes and a completely hysterical child. He recommends that you leave your child in bed during the naptime, regardless of whether your baby has fallen asleep or is crying, and says that sooner or later the child will fall asleep -- but not mine!  For five days in a row, twice a day, (much longer than the standard three days he says it will take) my daughter screamed for over 45 minutes straight and NEVER fell asleep.  It was a complete nightmare.  <br />Following this mess, I decided that naps in the swing weren't the end of the world -- and seriously, about two days after I began to allow my daughter to sleep in her swing at times during the day, she began to sleep through the night.  She started out sleeping from 11 PM until 4 or 5 AM, but she now goes to bed at 9:30 PM and doesn't get up until 6:30 AM.<br />More than anything else, you need to follow your own instincts as a parent.  Although I'm sure my daughter won't remember the horrible weeks where I tried to force consistent naps on her, I will -- and I've learned to follow her cues better, but more importantly to trust myself first and foremost.  We as parents spend more time with our children than anyone else, and we know more than we think we do.	2002-08-16	4

Some say it works better for formula fed babies but my son was breastfed and it worked great. He was always a chubby baby, and maintained that look through this training. He thrived! The key in this book is the general \\"routine\\" that is endorsed. Eat, play, sleep, eat, and so on. My son slept through the night by 2 and a half months old, ate well, played well, and is overall a great result from using this book as a guide to your routine. Ideally you want the schedule to be a 3 hour cycle, but initially of course it is not as long since younger babies obviously need more feedings than older ones. That's fine -- use your instincts and adjust the schedule time as your baby's needs indicate. Many AP parents slam this book, but I think the trouble comes from following ANY book to the letter. This is a good framework with which to regulate your days, and instincts don't get ignored if don't want them to be. There is no advocation of starving your child for the sake of schedule -- depsite what many AP parents seem to think. It clearly says that by all means, if baby is hungry, feed him! My son started off eating every 1.5 hours, and we still used this plan within that time, he gradually worked up to 3 and then 4 hours per \\"cycle\\" as he grew. <BR>This is NOT a book to read if you can't follow your gut, if you feel that any book has all the answers. There were certainly aspects of the text that rubbed me the wrong way, which I flatly ignored. But the gist was great -- get your baby used to a routine -- babies thrive on predictability, which is security to them. It also encourages you to learn the cries -- not every cry is a hunger cry and that can be a problem if you think you have to feed your baby every time he cries -- that can lead to discomfort for the baby and thus more crying.<br />The other thing that is controversial about this book is letting your baby cry at bedtime. Again, this is a highly misunderstoodpractice. You don't just close the door on your child, or his needs. You begin gently teaching him (when his physical age signifies readiness) that bedtime is not negotiable. You don't just abandon your child...you reassure him and soothe him but within a framework that teaches him that crying is not how we get out of going to bed. My son is now 19 months old and he rarely ever protests bedtime (which is somewhere between 7 and 8pm every night). He goes down happily, usually without a fuss, and wakes by 8am the next morning very rested and happy. He knows crying to get out of bedtime just won't work, so why bother. I truly believe this healthy sleep habit came about because of our \\"wise\\" use of the routine and sleep training methods explained in the book.<br />DO NOT follow any book to the letter. All books are skewed by opinions of the writers, and what worked for them may not work for you for whatever reason, yours or the baby's. But the framework and logic is sound, in my opinion, and adaptable to suit the needs of your household. One thing that I didn't like was the book does not encourage a lot of holding your baby -- I think that should have been emphasized more. Babies need to be held and loved on when they are awake, and since they are being taught a bit of independence in their sleep, there's no need to withold the affection in their waking time. Spoil them with love!!	2002-08-01	4

It goes against all natural instincts you have to care for your baby and instead teaches rigid schedules that are convenient for the parent, regardless of the babys needs. I did more research on this before following it and found that some babies actually have to be hospitalized when the parents follow the feeding advice since they are undernourished. I was really hoping to find good information on getting my baby to sleep, but its only a small part of the book anyway, and not very good ideas at that (put your baby in the crib and let him cry). I ended up throwing this book away and buying a more compassionate one called The No-Cry Sleep Solution. My baby and I are both much happier.	2002-07-30	4

I do not recommend any parent follow anything this book has to say.  All it teaches if for parents to deny their natural insticts to pick up and care for their crying baby, and it teaches babies to distrust their parents.  Of course babies will stop crying and fall asleep after being left to cry it out - they are exhausted and scared.

Clearly there are different parenting practices based on various philosphical prejudices and presuppositions as to how babies best \\"operate.\\" As a new parent, I read babywise about 4 times, and it just plain works for some people (many five star ratings are entitled: \\"It Really Works!\\" or something to that affect). But there are some problems too. For example, Ezzo lays things out as \\"the way things are,\\" without a lot of room for conflicting studies. Yes, there are well researched studies that demonstrate contrary \\"facts\\" regarding babies, sleeping schedules, feedings and so forth. Let me suggest three steps toward better discernment before one is prone to leap at this book in a fit of sleepless exhaustion looking for the cure -- the quick-fix.<br />1) Read about fifteen to twenty reviews here on Amazon.com. Many are pretty short (except for mine?) ;) and provide you with the spectrum of possible responses (from the logical to the emotionally reactionary). Many are very intelligent and insightful, and I have nothing extra to contribute except a call to expand one's repertoire!<br />2) Well, expand that darn repertoire! In other words read a couple more books  -- at leat one more! I recommend \\"What To Expect the First Year.\\" That one's always updated and contains much hard data that is sometimes in contrast to Ezzo's work. Look, I can't tell you how many nurses said different things while my wife and I were at the hospital (citing studies to boot!) so if you're looking for the one LAW OF BABY, it just doesn't exist. The point is to become somewhat of an authority on matters yourself so you can make the best decision for your baby given all the available data. I'm not saying go to med-school, just get the spectrum. After reading a few reviews and expanding your repertiore of books-on-hand, you may find yourself realizing the next step.<br />3) Be flexible, all babies are different. Take what's good, throw out the bad; it's that simple. At least that part is. Putting anything into practice, especially where infants are concerned is anything but! Take Ezzo (and everyone else) with a grain of salt. It doesn't occur to many people who use babywise that there is a logical fallacy subtly at work: just because something seems to work doesn't mean it's hands down the best thing all the time for all people everywhere.<br />Putting baby on a routine is great. Creating a sense of consistency in the household which a vulnerable infant can depend on for a sense of security is fine. Just don't get one book and follow it like an owner's manual for babies as though they were a Sears appliance. Ezzo is wrong about some things, and my main red flag from his book is the lack of forthcomingness (or awareness perhaps?) and humility about other perspectives. He also raises some excellent points that are worth considering in balance with other views. Worth reading, but not alone!	2002-06-18	4

The people who have written negative reviews have the concepts of the book all wrong.  There's no way they could have read the whole thing thoroughly and gotten the impressions they did.  This book teaches you that 1)Full feedings are important for the baby 2)Babies can go to sleep on their own if you give them the chance and 3)You should not always assume your baby is hungry just because it cries.  It does not tell you to withold food unless it has been 4 hours since the last feeding, that is a false statement another reviewer wrote.  It tells you that you should get to know your baby well enough so that you as a parent can decide what it needs and give it to your baby.  And it stresses that if you asess your baby and think it is hungry, by all means, definitely feed the baby no matter how long it has been since the last feeding.  And it does not tell you to be unresponsive to your baby's emotional needs - the whole concept is to be able to decide what your baby needs and give it exactly that.  We've been using the book's teachings only a few weeks and parents and baby are happier and healthier already.	2002-06-05	4

The author has lots of good points about having a good marital relationship with your spouse but as far as his parenting philosophy:teaching an 8 week old to eat every 4 hours and sleep all through the night is absurd! The book is anti-bonding and Ezzo's philosophy is to not hold the baby too much because he or she will become spoiled. The little boy I watch is 4 months old and a nervous wreck. I suppose the parents are happy because he DOES sleep through the night but he is not a very happy baby. He is lethargic, cranky. (He still cries and screams 3 hours after eating). His parents come to pick him up and he doesn't smile at them and doesn't even look them in the eye! His mother wants us to keep him awake 2 hours after a feeding to \\"play\\" but he is so grouchy he usually cries for 15 minutes and then falls asleep.<br />There is also a 3 month old I watch that is demand fed, smiles and coos, AND sleeps 10 hours a night by herself!<br />It makes me sad that this is happening all over.

A co-worker of mine recommended this book to me after I had not slept more than 4 hours at a time in 6 weeks.  I was convinced my daughter had insomnia.  She never slept more than 30 minutes at a time during the day and only for one four hour stretch at night (and that was a good night).  After reading this book and using it's schedule, my daughter started taking regular 1.5 hour naps throughout the day and sleeping at least 6 hours through the night.  This book is very easy reading and speaks in very plain terms.  The basic philosophy is to teach your child how to eat regularly (not snack) and establish healthy sleep patterns (without the use of props, such as swings, rocking, etc.).  <br />I had to learn to listen to my baby cry in her crib for a while so that she learned to fall asleep on her own, but the payoff was a much happier, more content baby during her waking hours and a mom who felt in control and well rested enough to actually sing and play with her baby.  It's a must for all new moms.	2002-05-26	4

The pattern they teach is to feed your baby, then play with them (even if it's only for 2 minutes when they're brand new) and then to put them to sleep.  They encourage the reader to pay attention to the cues from the baby and to make sure they are hungry before automatically feeding them every time they cry.

My mother, a labor and delivery nurse for 30 years, also read it and said, \\"this is mostly just good common sense.\\" She also told me what I want to share with others: you will become the expert on your baby. So, read good books like this one, consider how you feel about what you read, and be willing to try the general principles outlined in this book. We didn't always follow the Baby Wise guidelines if it didn't feel right or wasn't a good fit for our baby, but she did sleep through the night at 8 weeks of age and has done so consistently since week 10. Perhaps even better is her ability to put herself to sleep and the way she truly enjoys being in her crib. I believe the methods described in this book have helped us raise a healthy, happy, content baby who knows what she can expect from a consistent routine and trusts us completely.

But just as we do not feed a newborn a piece of steak, or expect them to walk over and pick up their bottle, we should remember not to have unrealistic developmental expectations with regards to sleep either.  If an infant is crying, whether for physical or for--just as valid--emotional needs, the parent should respond to those needs.  Ezzo's program does a disservice to infants for the sake of parental convenience.  Even his language shows his confusion between children and pets. <br />Most alarming, however, is that in the American Academy of Pediatrics newsletter (_AAP News_ of April 1998), the program set forth in Ezzo's book was linked to dehydration and failure to thrive.  Responding to increasing numbers of babies and children who were showing up at hospitals with failure to thrive, the American Academy of Pediatrics passed a resolution (#22T) calling on the AAP to \\"investigate the infant management program outlined in _Preparation for Parenting_ and _On Becoming Babywise_ and determine the extent of its potentially harmful effects on infant health and resolved that the AAP alert its members, other organizations, and parents of its findings and inform healthcare providers how to discern when the program is in use and how to facilitate patient care while on the program.\\"  <br />Like most parents, we found the first year to be just as demanding and exhausting as it was rewarding and remarkable.  Our 19-month-old is an engaged, inquisitive and smart toddler who sleeps well and is thriving happily.  Parents are amazed at her age because her poise, confidence and security are indicative of a much older child.  Fortunately, we avoided _Babywise's_ advice and chose to prioritize her needs to ours.  After all, who's the adult here?	2002-05-07	4

My son is five years old now, so I can tell you from five years of experience that this book works!  We followed the guidelines from the moment our son was born and it was great.  Of course, I had some problems, being a first-time mother, but the scheduling really helped me.  I was able to discern what my child was crying for during the day.  If he started being fussy, most times I realized it was close to his naptime and he was ready to go down.  This schedule helped me to bond with my baby.  I knew when he was going to be most alert and therefore the best time to play, sing and read to him.  I knew when he would be hungry and therefore, when I could make a trip to the grocery store or bank.  ...he slept through the night at 4 weeks!!!  ...  <BR>... Take it from someone who has already been through that stage, those people are dead wrong.  My son was happy, secure and very outgoing.  As a stay at home mom, he was with me at most times during the week, but when it came time for church or other activities where he went to a nursery-type environment, he generally went to the workers cheerfully, content in himself that I would be back for him soon.  He wasn't insecure, quite the opposite, he was very secure in my love.  <BR>Now that he's five, he still thrives on having a schedule.  Children love to know what's coming. ...

Reading some of the anti-postings about this book, I can't help but conclude that many (most?) of the anti-reviewers here haven't actually read the book.  The book isn't extremist, and I wasn't aware that the authors were even religious until someone told me later.<br />I have to think that something about the authors (their religion?) really, really irks some people.  Perhaps they haven't read the book, but have heard stories or have been influenced by others.  These angry people seem to have written a lot of the reviews here.  Honestly, I can't see what there is to get so excited about!<br />The book talks about putting your child on a schedule involving feeding, playing, sleeping.  You use a rough schedule of 2.5 to 3.5 hours between feedings.  In a nutshell, that's it!  Nobody is torturing anyone, and our baby seems pretty content.

Finding your baby's schedule (eating, sleeping, wake time) and learning your baby's cues are critical for success in getting your baby to sleep. It also helps both you and your baby \\"learn\\" to breastfeed. As a new parent with no clue where to begin, I found this book very helpful if approached in a flexible way.

I thought the authors did a good job of discussing and explaining the evolution of child-rearing theory. At times they got a little too detailed perhaps, but overall I appreciated understanding how they arrived at their viewpoint and the babywise methods. <br />Once my daughter arrived, I began to implement the ideas in this book. Now, 12 weeks later, I have a child that eats on a regular schedule of every 3-4 hours and sleeps 8 hours straight each night. I have several friends with children my daughter's age who have not followed these principles and they are still up several times each night with their babies and are at their baby's mercy as to when feedings and naps occur. I understand that many people disagree with the authors' ideas in this book (the lactation specialist in my hospital thought that it should be banned!), saying that if you do not feed your child when she wants to be fed she will feel unloved and traumatized. I prefer to follow the thinking of the Babywise authors and agree that an infant really doesn't understand exactly what she needs, she needs her parents to assist her in learning how to schedule herself. This book was very helpful in providing sample schedules and suggestions for feedings, though I didn't follow all of its advice (for exapmle, I could not bear to let my baby \\"cry it out\\" for a half hour at a time as they suggest!).<br />Overall, I thought this book was a wonderful help and would suggest any new parent read it.	2002-02-25	4

It's so sad to me that people would read this book and think it's a good way to interact with your baby, the most precious and vulnerable thing in the world.  Hopefully people have children to love them and be part of their family.  Having your child sleep through the night by eight weeks shouldn't be your primary objective.  Raising a healthy, well adjusted and happy baby should be your objective.  It just shows how out of whack our society is.  And people wonder why we have so many social problems.  It's because we value sleep and convienience over the well-being of our children.  We value time in front of the TV over time with our babies.  It is truly sad.  If you're looking for compassionate, yet balanced views on parenting and babies, look into some books by Dr. Sears.  Other good books are \\"Attachment Parenting\\" \\"Vital Touch\\" and \\"Our Babies Ourselves\\". That's where you will truly find the answer.	2002-02-17	4

They'll eventually figure out you're not going to come soothe them or feed them.  Dont you think that infancy is a little early for such harsh treatment??  I do.  It's a fact that babies rely on their parents for just about all of their emotional needs.  They need us to make them feel safe and secure.  This book teaches babies that their needs are second to ours, no exceptions.  It is frighteningly reminiscent of pet training manuals.  Hey, babies are people too!  Give them a break already!

Unfortunately, I cannot say much good about this book. So, I will begin by mentioning what I found useful - 1. the author, albeit rather forcefully, reminds us of the importance of maintaining the marital relationship (in my opinion, this should not be done at the expense of the child(ren). The addition of a child to the family signifies great life changes, including positive relationship changes); and 2. the author stresses the importance of learning to distinguish your baby's cries and choosing a course of action based on this (sometimes, however, you just can't tell what the problem is, and in this case the baby most likely just needs to be held). That's it for the positive. Although most would agree that infants and their families usually do better if they have some routine and structure in their day, the prescribed scheduling in this book is way, way to stiff. Yes, the author repeatedly tells you to be \\"flexible\\", but flexibility is very difficult to achieve while maintaining the routine. He also repeatedly tells you not to deviate so much (from scheduled feed or nap times) that you form a new \\"norm\\". Who needs to be this tied to a clock?<br />I am very unimpressed by most of the rest of the book. One thing that discredits it substantially is it's constant tirade against \\"attachment parenting\\" and \\"demand feeding\\". How sad that they have to resort to bashing other parenting styles in order to make their method seem good. Never mind the fact that the directives found within contradict well-established medical fact about infant care and feeding.<br />The author (Ezzo) does a good job of presenting his method as the only correct choice in parenting. He warms the reader up to his ideas with dire warnings of what will happen if they follow other parenting styles (attachment parenting), and pooh-poohs concerns about emotional effects of the large amounts of crying that will happen while trying to follow his plan.<br />His proposed schedule - eat, activity, sleep sounds nice and convenient, but is not realistic with a newborn. He advocates letting a baby from 8 days old cry itself to sleep in the name of helping the child learn to go to sleep on his own, without \\"negative\\" sleep props (cuddling, rocking, breastfeeding). Those expecting their first child will not know how impossible it can be to keep a newborn from falling asleep while nursing - and, once baby has eaten well, why would you want to keep him awake? Why deny a precious baby the comfort and security of drifting off to sleep in his most favorite place in the whole world? If it's sleep training you're worried about, this can be done much later in the child's life when she has a large file of positive, loving care to draw upon. I don't mean 3 years old, but after the first year. Also, many children don't require sleep training. They can be nursed to sleep and still learn to go to sleep on their own. Our first child learned to sleep on his own just fine, and he was nursed to sleep until he was weaned at 15 months. Putting a newborn \\"down to sleep\\" (more like down to cry, alone) several times a day, helps no-one. Your baby feels abandoned as he doesn't know it's his scheduled nap-time, he just knows he needs you. You feel stressed to the max because you want to comfort him but \\"the plan\\" doesn't allow you to (you'll end up with a selfish little beast). Acknowledged sleep experts, such as Ferber, don't recommend sleep training before 5 or 6 months of age. He also doesn't even begin to condone the \\"cold turkey\\" crying that Ezzo says you should do.<br />This book fails to recognize infants as individuals. All infants should be treated the same. What kind of robots is Ezzo trying to create? And how dare he insinuate that if you don't follow his plan, you are not a good parent? He states that \\"attachment parented\\" children are me-centered. His plan perpetuates me-centeredness in adults. It promotes adult selfishness when weshould be learning to be less selfish for the sake of someone else. I'm not advocating the type of extreme child-centered parenting that he describes, but one of the good changes we can see in ourselves as a result of becoming parents is the real ability to put someone else's needs above our own. <br />Overall, I believe this book is a dangerous bet, especially for first time parents. ...There are plenty of excellent parenting books available that respect the reader. (..) Enjoy the first year with your baby. It passes much too quickly. All children eventually do sleep through the night, often without any overt help on your part. Expect some ( or a lot sometimes) sleep deprivation. One of the best sleep suggestions I have seen is to give your child different sleep associations from the start.... Try putting your baby down drowsy, not totally conked. <br />We should be emotional about our children, despite Ezzo's contention that we shouldn't. Follow your instincts, no-one knows your baby better than you.<br />There is an excellent chapter on sleep and how it works in Richard Ferber's \\"Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems\\".	2002-02-07	4

Nothing will sell books faster to sleep deprived parents faster than a book promising to get their baby sleeping through the night.  I purchased this book before the birth of my son 2 years ago.  After reading it, I thought it would be very easy to get my son to sleep through the night using their cry it out method.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  A week or two after I first brought my son home from the hospital, I tried to let him cry it out to get him to go to sleep, and this was gut wrenching.  I knew in my heart it was wrong to let my son's needs go unheeded, so after trying this once or twice I soon learned that in order for us all to get some sleep I had to ignore that advice and nurse my son whenever he wanted.  This is what nature intended, not some ridiculous schedule.  Also, if you are breastfeeding, nursing on demand is a sure fire way to establish your milk supply.  Long story short, my son is now a happy, healthy, well-adjusted 22 month old who knows that his needs are met.  Do yourself a favor--  Ditch this book in favor of Dr. Sears' \\"The Baby Book\\".

Up until two weeks ago, my husband and I were trying to follow the \\"child centered/ on demand\\" schedule that is so pushed by lactation nurses and others with our first child.  She was up all the time, fussy and screaming, I was nursing her what seemed like nonstop, and my husband was sleeping on the couch. My husband and I were at odds at what to do, and completely sleep deprived.  We felt like we were in bondage.  Then a friend recommended this book, and OH MY GOSH!!!  I didn't know parenting could actually be enjoyable!  I am an RN and even I didn't know what to do!!  This book's common sense approach and flexible scheduling are just awesome.  Our daughter is so much happier, and so are we.  The critics that call it rigid must be out of their minds, because it is no such thing.  We are far from rigid, and now we are a happy family of three. Our 6 week old sleeps 5 hours at night, takes regular naps throughout the day, and is healthy and growing.  She is alert and smiling and so content.  As an RN, I agree with everything in the book.  It is healthy advice in everyway.  Thank God for this book!!!	2002-01-31	4

He does not suggest that you ignore, neglect, or abuse your child. He, instead, suggests a plan and a pattern to help you better understand the needs of your child.<br />With this understanding, a parent can more effectively meet the needs of their child. He suggests that if a parent feeds the child when he/she is hungry, then the baby will not need to cry for food. Therefore, a parent knows that if the baby is crying while awake, then there must be a reason besides hunger. If a parent allows for adequate sleep, then the child will not cry from being tired. Therefore, if the baby's crying, there must be another reason for it.<br />My seven month old has been THRIVING through a schedule guided by Ezzo's book. We have modified the schedule to meet our daughter's needs (i.e.; at one point it was obvious that she was getting hungry between feedings, so we adjusted her schedule to meet her needs), and Ezzo basically suggests this technique.<br />Overall, if you just read for a regimental schedule, then this book has it, but parents must realize the needs of their children and make adjustments as Ezzo advises.<br />Don't fall into the trap of ignoring this book by claims ... of UNINFORMED people who think that parents are abusing their children. You will provide for your baby's needs before they have to ask for it. I can't think of a better definition of a nurturing parent.	2002-01-29	4

I *loosely* followed \\"Babywise\\" at 6 months with my older son and then at 4 months for my younger son. I did so out of desperation: my older son wouldn't take more than a 10 minute nap during the day. He was breastfed on demand, had no schedule whatsoever, was carried around in a sling all day and never allowed to cry for more than a few seconds...and he wouldn't sleep when you tried to put him down! It just got worse and worse as he got older. I tried for 17 days straight to just put him down in the crib for naps, checking on him every 5 minutes or so...he would scream himself to sleep after 2 hrs and then wake up 15 minutes later, screaming. Within 2 days of putting him on a very flexible feeding schedule per the Babywise book(and not putting him down right after a feed), he was taking short naps without falling apart (which was enough for me at the time and I never followed the plan anymore than that).I still breastfed, carried him in a sling and attended to his cries-I just stopped stuffing his face *every* time he cried and I gently but firmly put him down for naps. The 2nd time around, my baby started off taking naps, but ended up like my 1st son by 4 months and I was exhausted! I 1st fed him every 2 hrs(I was feeding him sometimes more frequently than that!) and started putting him down around the same times everyday for *scheduled* naps.....sure, he screamed, but within 2 days, he started falling asleep without even a whimper! By 4 days, I started feeding every 3 hrs during the day and 2 hrs in the evening (he seemed hungrier). It has only been 1 week, but he slept 7 hrs straight thru the night one time and he naps during the day, usually without more than 5 minutes of crying. He has gone from being fussy and irritable to much calmer and smilier!  For me, following the\\"feed/wake/sleep\\" pattern does provide a reference point for my son's \\"typical\\" behavior. Also,I don't just \\"plop\\" him in the bed- I always pat him and kiss him and gently say \\"it's time to goto sleep\\" for about a minute (as a bridge for him to get ready to go to sleep). I think the book allows for some flexibility...ask yourself, \\"is my baby *really* hungry or is he tired?\\" and I think that is one of the keys to this book. If your baby is older than one month and truly tired, if you keep feeding him every 30 minutes and he keeps fussing, screaming, or falling asleep at the breast, maybe he's sleepy!!!<BR>I think some babies really need a schedule and it does help them get organized and synchronized....At least for me, loosely following the book has made a difference and has allowed me to get some more sleep and have a bit of personal time (which makes me a happier, more patient mommy!).	2002-01-25	4

We were sold on the book's theories right then and there.  <br />Some of our immediate family were somewhat skeptical, but they became converts after a very short time.  They were astounded when they'd visit and we'd simply lay our children down in their cribs when it was nap time or bed time and they'd happily go to sleep on their own without a single cry.  They were equally surprised when they would wake up in a fantastic mood (not crying) and ready to play.  You may think that it was just the baby's personality -- but both of them?

They have different personalities and different needs.  They are not little pieces of machinery who need to be programmed to sleep for the convenience of their parents.  And they are not little works of \\"original sin\\" who need to be taught a lesson.<br />When a baby cries, it is for a reason.  This is their way of telling you that they need something, not some sinister attempt to manipulate you.  Actually, BabyWise is a white-washed version of Ezzo's original program.  In the original program, he compared letting a baby scream in its crib to God's decision to let Jesus cry out on the cross without intervening.  He explains how glad he is that God didn't respond to Jesus' cries and seems to imply that God was providing parents a model for how to treat their children.  In my humble opinion, this is sick.<br />A baby may scream for two hours and then go to sleep, but in the process they have gotten a very clear message from their new world: \\"Your needs are unimportant, so you just better give up.\\"  So after their throats are soar, their noses are stuffed up and they're physically exhausted, they do give up and this becomes a permanent imprint on their little minds.  Is that really the message we want our children to take with them for the rest of their life?<br />And you know what?  For every well-meaning parent that Ezzo draws into this \\"program\\", there are a load more who are really glad that they now have \\"permission\\" to just \\"let 'em scream.\\"  After all, the point is to have a \\"parent-centric\\" family where children \\"fit in\\" and aren't too much of a bother, right?	2002-01-17	4

I was given this book by someone who believed in it, and have heard from several others that this is the way to go. I even thought it was great myself. I certainly want my baby to sleep through the night, in her own bed, and be on a perfect predictable schedule. HOWEVER, you must be flexible with babies. There is so much more going on. This book made me feel guilty for doing what I felt was right at the time (comforting my baby, rocking her to sleep, etc.) and made me feel obligated to stay on a schedule regardless of the needs of my baby. When you're breastfeeding, sometimes you need to feed every hour or two during growth spurts, for example - otherwise, your milk supply will not increase as needed, and you and your baby will both be unhappy. I couldn't find where the book addressed that issue. Still, the idea of setting up a routine is a good one, and the child *shouldn't* be the center of your universe - these are ideals you should strive for... But the author is entirely too opinionated (and adamant!) on the subject, leading new inexperienced parents to feel guilty for following their instincts. <br />Also, he mentions several strategies which are not explained, such as putting your baby down for a nap. The way this is discussed in the book, you should just be able to walk a fully awake baby into his room, plop them in the crib and go on about your business. According to Ezzo, the baby will cry himself to sleep within minutes. HA HA HA. I tried this a number of times, even using the Ferber method of checking in every 15 minutes or so. 2 hours later, I ended up giving in and feeding my daughter. Some babies just don't take to this as well as others, I guess. So, Ezzo - just how do you get the baby to that point??? You left that very important detail out of the book!<br />You know, the transition from womb to world is just a little to harsh to be imposing all these strict ideals so early on. Be flexible, and follow your instinct. Use this book as a guide, but notas a bible!	2002-01-16	4

This book was recommended to me when I was pregnant with my first child. Although I didn't agree with everything it had to say, it made sense to me. My child began sleeping through the night at 7 weeks. He is now a happy 2 1/2 year old. People are amazed at how happy and content he is. And believe me he knows that he is loved by two parents who treasure him more than life itself. <br />Yes, the benefit of this book is to get your child to sleep through the night sooner rather than later. However, I think the point of the book is to remember to keep your family a parent-centered family rather than a child-centered family. I'm not sure what other parents have against discipline but it is a necessary part of growing up. <br />The key thing to remember when reading this or any book is that you need to digest the material and take away from the book the items that will work for you. No, I did not do 100% of what Ezzo said in his book but I did the majority of them. Perhaps I have a little more common sense than others. <br />Baby number two is due in a month and my husband and I have every intent of having another happy and healthy &quot;Baby Wise&quot; baby.	2002-01-08	4

I read it and thought &quot;that sounds great !&quot;  The book basically takes a your the boss and you shouldn't have to change your life to fit your childs needs stand.  Once I got home with my baby that all changed.  Putting him on a schedule was one thing but following the advice of letting him cry for hours on end until he figured it out was heart breaking.  I think that what everyone loses sight of is that each child is an individual.  What works for one baby won't for another.  The danger in this book falls in making a new parent feel like a failure if there heart won't allow them to follow the advice of not picking up your crying child.  Babies are thrown into this world not by there choice but by yours which means it is your responsiblity to give them love and care.  Not only does this book talk about letting your child scream for hours; but about not picking them up when they are awake(don't want to spoil them or make them feel wanted), not wearing them in any kind of carrier etc.. but you can play with them during &quot;awake&quot; times.  No rocking your sweet baby to sleep while nursing.  If I had followed this advice I would have missed out on SO many wonderful moments with my son even if some of them were at three in the morning.  I instead picked up a Dr.sears book after feeling like a failure for following my heart and knowing I couldn't do that to my son.  Dr.Sears made me feel so much better and not only had medical experience he has 6 children of his own.  Babywise makes you think his way is the only way.  In all reality it is not you caqn give your baby all the rocking ,holding, cuddling, and yes even sleeping with you in the same bed!! And your child will sleep through the night on his own as did my son only after following Dr. Sears knider gentler methods.  To me this book just gave the &quot;ok&quot; to people who want to not listen to what there baby is asking for which may be more thanwhat they thought parenthood would be. I think that is were all the occurences of neglect and malnutrition come from, people who say &quot;hey this guy says I can just throw the baby in the crib and come back every three hours or so&quot; of course that is not what he says directly but that is what they hear, as do I.<BR>One more thing.  Trying to get your baby on a schedule is of course the ultimate goal in parenthood for many.  My issue was with the many other statements made against parents who do end up co-sleeping, baby carrying, rocking, demand feeding, and just plain loving on there child.  He states that these children aren't as independent as are baby-wise babies.  I am happy to report that as completely untrue.  My son was sitting up at 4 months crawling by 5 and walking by 9.  He is the happiest toddler I know.  My sister followed this book without waiver and yes her children were sleeping through the night by 6 weeks but neither of them were even able to sit up at nine months the oldest didn't walk until 15 months and the youngest not until 18.  I have to think this has something to do with not be held of comforted or a part of the world around them.  But hey they defiantely aren't &quot;spoiled&quot;.  Your child may sleep all night early by following this book but think about what the long term effects may be because I am sure that when a child has a problem at 4 years old with behavior the parent will not remember how they treated their child as an infant and the effect it may have had.	2002-01-06	4

This book was recommended to me by numerous friends who have had success with this program.  Their children range from 6 months old to 5 years old and all are healthy and happy.  We read this book, and many others with a critical eye and decided to use Ezzo's philosophy.  Contrary to what many have written, his ideas are not rigid or unloving, they are just the opposite.  He teaches structure WITH flexibility, and above all, love your child!!<br />Our girl is 11 weeks old, VERY healthy, and yes, she only eats 6 -8 times a day.  The doctors have said that she is thriving!!  She is very happy and eats and sleeps well with VERY minimal crying.  <br />Some have said that this book teaches you to ignore your babies cues and just let them cry.  Not true, the book teaches you to listen to your babies cries FOR the cues.  We have done this and yes, sometimes we do not pick her up when she cries...why...because she is tired.  When we hear her &quot;tired&quot; cry we put her down and wham, she is asleep in two minutes.  But when it is two in the morning and I hear &quot;I'm hungry&quot; or &quot;I want to be held&quot; cry, then thats what I do. What I don't do is stuff food in her mouth everytime she cries.<br />The book teaches flexibility and we USE it, yes, the goal is to go 2.5 - 3.0 hours between feeding.  But that doesn't mean you let your child starve...many times we fed her when she was crying at two hours or less.  But we kept using the ideas in the book and now she goes for three hours minimum during the day, and 7-9 hours at night, and no, we didn't starve her.  <br />One of the greatest parts about getting our baby on a schedule is that she knows and we know when certain events happen.  We know that as soon as she wakes up, she eats, then there is play time, then nap time.  We don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out what our daughter wants because we know at what point in the schedule weare at.  Does this mean she is perfect and follows it to a tee, no, but for the most part we know what to expect and so does she.  To give you an example, during the day when she wakes up from her naps she generally does NOT cry, she quielty talks to herself, we go pick her up and she SMILES, yes she is hungry but she doesn't cry, why, she knows she is about to be fed,she is used to this schedule and she patiently waits until I warm her bottle of breast milk or until mom is ready. She eats well and then we laugh together for about an hour until it's naptime again.<br />This book has been a blessing to us.  We don't use it as a law book, just a reference.  But I can tell you we have been VERY happy with the results, and so has our daughter.	2002-01-01	4

People commented time and again about how easy our children were, just exactly the way the book said they would. Our girls slept through the nights at 9 and 9 1/2 weeks and so did we.

I am downright confused and baffled by all of the hysteria about this book, and feel obliged to give the other side equal time!  Our fifteen month-old twins have been happily and easily sleeping through the night since they were nine weeks old, thanks to Ezzo's suggestions.  I believe this healthy routine is fundamental to their emotional and neurological development. (Don't we all thrive on schedules?)  Ezzo doesn't recommend strict adherence to schedules at all costs--just that the parent ease the infant toward a three-hour or whatever schedule, then sleeping through the night when the child is physically able and ready to do so, all the while paying attention to and meeting his needs.  Ezzo gave me the confidence to create healthy structure for my twins (born in September 2000) and we are all thriving!  Bottom line:  this book is a tool, and a confident, mature parent possessing simple common sense can use its principles to great advantage!	2001-12-23	4

Truly this was a special gift when a friend had advised me to try this program. This program also comes with a video series. I had  viewed the series with 5 other couples whm have had or were expecting children. Another friend who expecting her 6th child stated that her very 1st child was on a demand feeding  schedule and has since done the baby wise technique on the other 5 children. She stated that is why she decided to ave 5 more children. Because of the baby wise phylosophy! I have done this baby wise technique with my first child 5 years ago and it worked in 6  to 8 weeks following her birth. With my son who is 10 months old it took a little longer to get him to sleep through the night. It took 11 to 12 weeks. I nursed both children until they were 4 and 7 months of age. They both also have very different personalities. This techniqu is very flexible and workable in any family situation provided that all parties cooperate with what you are doing. The crying can get on your nerves but usually doesn't last very long in the grand scheme of life. My babies are very well behaved most of the time and very friendly and enjoyable to be around. As kids are they do have there moments but are very well rounded socially and mentally. Excellent book and the most usefull tool since the diaper!:)	2001-12-09	4

I followed the same &quot;sleeping and eating routine&quot; outlined in the book.  My 4 week old went from eating every 1 1/2 hours to every 3 hours which made my life wonderful.  Before reading this book, all I did was feed and change and my child would only take 15-20 minute naps.  At 8 weeks, we was eating every three hours and taking at least 2 naps that lasted 90 minutes.  As for starving him by following Baby Wise.....people read way too much into it.  I never starved my child, just taught him to be on a schedule.  As for striking a child....I never read where you actually &quot;strike&quot; a child.  I read where you discipline them.  I read to hold their hands down at the dinner table.  I have been told by many people that I don't even know that stop and talk to my baby that he is the happiest baby they have ever seen.  He smiles at everyone, and he is a baby wise baby.<br />Just to let you know... my pediatrician told me at his 2 months check-up that if I wanted him to sleep through the night to let him cry for 45 minutes (same as baby wise).  For the first night he cried 35 minutes.  The next night 10..then 5.  Now at 9 months we put him down and he never cries.<br />As for being loved.  This child knows that he is loved.  We always hold him when he takes a bottle.  We always play with him for hours each day, but he is also disciplined.  He knows when it is bedtime and he knows his routine of a bath, a book, a prayer, and music.<br />If you do not discipline you will have a child that doesn't behave.  I am not saying STRIKE the child.  As parents you are the boss and you are responsible for raising a child that can go out into public and behave.  <br />My daycare follows babywise..childwise and that is why I love it.  It is structured.  All babies are on the same schedule and sleep at the same time.  My baby went from a daycare where he slept with the lights on while other babies cried to a daycare where they turn off the lights and have a fan that makes noise.  They teach him to lay still on the changing table and keep his hands down when being fed.  This is discipline...not abuse.	2001-11-26	4

As much as routine equates security it does not speak to raising a self-confident child that can adapt and overcome.  This program which was a savior during the first 3-6 months became a burden. Life revolved around their schedules which became difficult to change.

And then only if I was not paying attention to the schedule.  My child started sleeping through the night (9 hours) at 6 1/2 weeks.  I had my second child 6 months ago, and at 7 weeks, he started sleeping 12 hours a night.  And he still does!  I am a much nicer and happier mother when I have had a full night's rest.  They are happy too!  There has been some bad press about the authors, but I think that comes about when certain readers are militant about sticking to every little detail no matter what.  This book does not tell you to force your child to conform to whatever you decide is best.  You just should use common sense and make sure that the babies are having an adequate number of wet and poopy diapers and gaining the right amount of weight.  You will be able to tell if you just pay attention.  If they are thriving, they will be happy!  P.S.  With my first child I nursed, and with my second I bottle fed.

Although we don't follow the book word for word, it has given us a wonderful basis on which to build. We don't have our baby on a rigid schedule, but we have given him a routine. He knows what to expect next and has really taken to that routine. Our 11 week old son now sleeps from about 9pm to about 6am (this varies of course, but he has a nice long stretch which gets us all a good night's sleep). Mom also knows when she'll have time to take a shower and get some work done around the house. Everyone has a happier disposition, including baby, since we've started using some of the Baby Wise methods.<br />I would and do recommend this book to all my expecting friends.

She has continued to stretch this out and now at 20 weeks, sleeps 10 1/2 hours solidly, with never any wake-ups in the middle of the night. If you are a staunch supporter of demand-feeding and full-time sling-wearing, this book will likely be offensive to you and of no help.  I had no real inclination prior to having my first child, and after reading the La Leche's philosophy and Ezzo's, I felt that the latter best suited my parenting style.

At first I was thrilled to learn parenting techniques that would give me the ability and confidence to raise a Godly child, but the more I read, the more doubts I began to have.<br />I believe that the Ezzos have some very good points:  We should raise Godly children.  We should teach our children to be obedient.  I also have some deep concerns.<br />I had trouble with my son gaining weight.  Fortunately since I am a pediatric nurse,  I realized his failure to gain weight within days and visited a lactation consultant to correct the problem.  I am worried about the circular reasoning that the book presents:  1. This method will work. 2. If it is not working, it is because you are not applying the method correctly.  This &quot;logic&quot; traps many young parents into three categories: Those who succeed and view anyone who fails or chooses not to follow the Ezzos teaching as inferior, Those who fail but keep trying the method feel dispair and guilt, and those who fail and choose to look elsewhere for advice and are ostracized by other Ezzo devotees.  You can see the divisive possibilities in churches who use this program.<br />Please keep in mind that God created you to be your child's parent.  God gives you the power of choice to choose what will be best for your child.  He trusts that you will trust Him to lead you.  Also remember that there are many Godly people out there with good parenting advice.  Read a lot, pray a lot, love your child deeply, and the answers will come.  God bless	2001-10-16	4

All the advice I got was to feed him on demand.  This was wrong for me and for him. He was crying all day and never satisfied. I couldn't even take a shower.  Within three days of following the Babywise guidelines, everyone was happier; parents and baby.  The approach to discipline worked as well (although we have never subscribed to hand slapping).  The idea of allowing your child only the freedoms that he can handle is excellent and let us discipline with foresight into the future. We have a 2 1/2 year old who can sit through dinner at a nice restaurant and has slept through the night for two years.  We do not have the problems our peers have with getting their toddlers to take naps or being in public.  All the playgroup parents comment on how well behaved and happy our child is.  He is a joy to be around, and I believe a lot of it is due to Babywise.  As with anything, you need to do what you feel good about; we did not follow this to the letter.  Having our baby get used to the schedule was not easy.  But once we saw the results, we continued and he did cry considerably less than before using Babywise.	2001-10-09	4

Her weight gain is near the top of the charts (12 pounds, 12 ounces at 8 weeks), and she smiles and does all the usual cute baby stuff.  She has as much cuddling and contact as she can handle, and she sleeps in her own room within earshot.  Weve had family babysitters twice, and she has cried with neither while we enjoyed evenings out.<br />Baby Wise was a gift from a trusted friend.  Over the years we have been amazed at the polite and cheerful demeanor of her two kids, and the serenity of the parents.  We asked her, How did you do it?!?.  This gift was her answer.  We read the book together, pausing to discuss each chapters implications as we went.<br />We treat Baby Wise as a guide, not as gospel, and have consulted many other sources recommended by our pediatrician (who leans to demand feeding but accepts other methods) and friends.  Careful reading shows that nothing in Baby Wise advocates mindless allegiance without thought.  We were flexible, used common sense and didnt proceed blindly because the book says so.  We have incorporated pieces of several theories, but Baby Wise has proved to be among the most useful.<br />Parent Directed Feeding has helped us find some sanity and reason in what can be a very frustrating time.  At 3-4 weeks we werent sure if we were doing the right thing; her feedings were strong, but she wasnt going more than 4-5 hours between nighttime feedings.  We stuck with it however, and at 6 weeks she jumped one night to 10 hours.  Of course we will never know what would have happened if we hadnt trusted Baby Wise, and I'm sure millions of people have been successful with other methods (methods which by the way change from year to year and decade to decade).

When my son was born, they told me in the hospital to feed him whenever he cried &quot;or my milk wouldn't come in.&quot;  After a few days of feeding him every five minutes much of the day and night I was exhausted, discouraged, sore, and seriously questioning my ability to be a parent.  I knew that this method of feeding would not work for me.<br />&quot;Baby Wise&quot; was recommended to me by many parents, and one friend loaned it to me.  It was just what I needed.  It told me how often a newborn needs to eat and how that changes as he grows older.  It costs nothing, contrary to warnings others might give you, and takes much less time than stuffing a nipple in your child's mouth every time she fusses.  Babies don't need to eat constantly to know that they are loved and secure.  Who would want their child to find security in food anyway? <br />My son is nearly 8 weeks old.  He has been sleeping through the night since he was 2 1/2 weeks old.  He is happy and healthy and has grown wonderfully.  Even better, I feel well-rested and healthy and know that I am able to be an alert, attentive, and energetic mother to my son.  Despite what they told me in the hospital, I can make plenty of milk without becoming a full-time milk dispenser.  I can easily let others babysit him, and I can take him out with me.  Just like the book predicted, people always talk about what an &quot;easy&quot; baby he is.  <br />I realize that not every baby will embrace a schedule as well as my son, but I encourage every new parent to try to put their child on a schedule.  It won't hurt them, it won't cost you a penny, and it may save your sanity!	2001-10-03	4

She had decided that if this was motherhood, she wouldn't have another child.  He was waking up 3-4 times every night and she was exhausted, physically and mentally.  After she read the book, she used the principles, and within a week he was sleeping through the night.  I've used the routine with all 3 of my kids.  By the 3rd, who is now 9 months old, it had become second nature for me.  All 3 slept through the night in 2-3 months.  There are always exceptions to the rule, however.  Some parents and some babies may not do well with this.  But I wouldn't blame the method.  You respond to your baby's needs according to the framework of the method.  It makes it easier to determine what they need.  I was able to sleep at night, recover from the birth, function during the day, and love and enjoy my babies.  I recommend it to anyone.  If you feel more comfortable shortening the time between feedings, do it.  It will take longer to sleep through the night, but that's okay too.  Use it, but in a semi-relaxed way.  My only suggestion would be to have a woman's touch in the writing.	2001-09-19	4

I tried it with my daughter from day 1, and I will never regret it no matter who hates this book. My daughter is and always has been very healthy and in the 75% percentile in height, size, and weight. She was sleeping through the night at 8 weeks of age. This book helped our family enjoy one another through stabilization and routine. I just had my baby boy, and I used the same program for him. He is as &quot;chubby&quot; as they come and is sleeping through the night at 7 weeks old. Because of his schedule that I adopted from the book, he and my daughter are happy and healthy. They know they are loved and have never felt insecure due to lack of routine. I strongly would recommend this book, but you must read it for yourself. Don't read some of these previous negative reviews and say &quot;forget it.&quot; Read it for yourself and then decide if you think this program will work for your family. ***One more thing: I was so nervous as a first time mom and had the &quot;baby blues&quot; pretty bad. This book helped bring structure to my life and my precious baby's life. I loved the outcome so much that I used the same program for my son, and because I knew what I was doing now, this time around it was so much easier.	2001-08-29	4

Each of the women that told me about this books suggested that I buy the book and read it before I even came home with the baby. They were so right. With the help of this book, my son was sleeping through the night in about 8 or 9 weeks. That made him happier and it made my husband and me happier because we were much less sleep deprived.

All of them have had success when they are consistant and stick to the Babywise ideals.  As to the sleeping...I've learned it's very simple.  Babywise teaches the baby to fall asleep on their own.  Not like Dr. Ferber that suggests you let the child cry themselves to sleep nor using the bottle or nursing as a crutch to getting your child to go to sleep.  It's all very healthy and natural and makes for a happy baby, a happy dad and a happy mom.	2001-08-16	4

The first time with my daughter, when she was 5 weeks old. She was sleeeping 8 hours a night by 8 weeks old. I breastfed successfully for 10 months with her (she self-weaned because I was pregnant with my second.) She is now 2 years old and I often get compliments on her sweet, easy going nature and how well she rests for naps and bedtime. I haven't had a fuss from her for either in over a year. She actually LIKES bedtime. :)<br />With my son, I decided to &quot;try things a little different&quot;, just to see if the Ezzo methods had been what had made my daughter such a great sleeper. I found out the hard way that I should have done the same with him! He co-slept with us for the first 4 months, and was not on a regular schedule. He was cranky, demanding and so were my husband and I. <br />I wised up and went back to the principles that had helped me with my daughter. Not less than a week after putting him on a schedule, he became the same kind of great sleeper his sister was! He's now 8 months old and sleeps 12 hours straight at night! Such a difference! He's still breastfed successfully also and doing great. His disposition has improved and oh how I wish I'd done this sooner!<br />I am amazed at the bitter and negative resposes posted here about this book. Most of the &quot;controversy&quot; is misrepreseted, as my dh and I spent considerable time researching every &quot;claim&quot; against this man. All came out to be misrepresented or blatant lies. It's amazing how rumors can spread, but noone takes the time to follow up to make sure they are accurate. <br />I have known many families who used either the Ezzo books or the Sears materials. It's amazing to me how many attachment parents have &quot;high needs&quot; or &quot;fussy&quot; babies compared to the Ezzo ones. It's almost laughable it's so obvious. Children need parental guidance -even with sleep. They thrive and do well if parents set limits and use common sense.<br />If you're still not sure what to do -- take a look at some of the families you know and find out how they parented. The familes with whiny, difficult children, and cranky parents likely didn't use this book, and the ones with calm, disciplined children and happy babies likely did.	2001-08-14	4

This book was recommended to me when I was pregnant with my first child.  My husband and I both read it and our now, 26 month old son, has been sleeping through the night since he was 7 weeks old.  He is such a happy and loving baby.  He has never fought bed-time and now that he is a little older, I think he enjoys his alone time in his bed.  As I prepare for baby #2, which is due in February, I plan to reread this book.  And as I did the first time, I will incorporate Mr. Ezzo's words with my own common sense and do what I feel is best at any given time.  I have complete confidence that our next child will be able to sleep through the night at an early age and that he/she will be just as happy, healthy and loving because of the parent-centered family that he/she has been born into.<br />This book is wonderful.  Every new parent, with common sense, should have a copy.	2001-08-13	4

So as a first time mother I am now trying it as well.  I am not going to lie, it is hard at first to put your newborn on a schedule, but it is a lot easier than what I went through in the first week and a half of demand feeding.  I was demand feeding my baby every hour and a sleepless mom is a cranky mom.  I started my daughter on this schedule when she turned 2 weeks old, and already she knows the difference between night and day, and we have to wake her for her feedings.  My milk supply has run short but I have just been pumping extra and that helps out a lot, also that helps my husband bond with the baby, he gets up at 3am to feed her while mommy can sleep a little extra.  It is hard work no matter what to be a parent but I believe this book makes a lot of sence and no where in the book does it say to starve your baby, if you feel your baby is truly hungry feed her even if it isn't her feeding time yet.	2001-08-05	4

It is not abusive or dangerous!  My son is being brought up in a very loving and caring Christian home, and because of what this book teaches, he was able to regulate his nights and days exceptionally early.  Not only was this a blessing to his parents, but it made his transion from womb-to-world a more enjoyable and less frustraing one.  I have at least four friends that I can name off the top of my head that have also read and used this book, and are overwhelming thankful for it's insights.  All of their children slept through the night at an early age as well.

This book stresses over and over again that the suggestions are guidelines for parents - not hard and fast rules.  This book shows parents how to parent intelligently, with full faculties, not just emotion.  It very much says that parents should respond to crying, but with the right kind of response.  Crying is the only form of communication babies have and it is up to the parents to interpret what they are.  If a child spoke:  \\"I'm hungry, I'm tired, I'm wet, I\\"m scared, I'm bored\\" you wouldn't automatically feed them!  You would do the appropriate response, which may be feeding...	2001-07-31	4

It is a wonderful resource that has made a huge difference in our family.  Every day we thank God for the Ezzos and their book!  Everything in the book came true.  For example: our daughter learned to sleep through the night at 8 weeks, we did not have to baby proof our house, and everywhere we went people said &quot;what a happy baby.&quot;  Whenever we had a concern we opened the book and found the solution listed right there.  It gave us confidence in our parenting because we had a resource to which to turn.  Our daughter has just turned 2 and now naps two hours in the afternoon and sleeps 11 hours at night.  Because she is so well rested, she is alert and happy during the day.  We know 3 other couples that had babies at the same time we did.  All of us followed the Babywise principles and we all had great results.  Each of our children is unique, with a different temperament and different skills - and they all are flourishing.  We all also implemented the principles in Babywise II and the class called &quot;Growing Kids God's Way.&quot;  I have studied most of the criticism of Babywise and of the Ezzos.  Sometimes I wonder if the critics have even read the book!  I find the most common critisism to be that people didn't want their babies to cry when hungry.  Neither does Babywise!  Babywise says over and over to feed your baby if its hungry.  So, don't let that worry stop you from reading the book. Other critics say it is the easy way out and solely for the convenience of the parent.  Parenting is an incredibly important responsibility and I don't think it is ever easy.  However, using this book you at least have a basic parenting philosophy and a baseline against which you can compare other advice.  I recommend it wholeheartedly!	2001-07-27	4

The so-called Christian methods of the Ezzos have been condemned by the American Academy of Pediatrics (a very conservative organization) because so many infants whose parents have followed the advice in this book have had to be treated for failure to thrive (read:  starving).  The Ezzos have no training at all in nutrition or in the mechanics of breastfeeding yet insist in promoting a rigid feeding schedule which causes breastfed babies to starve, promoting the idea that most modern mothers sadly &quot;can't&quot; breastfeed.  I am not even going to go into their ridiculous ideas about how infants are spoiled if you hold them and attend to them or about how they advocate striking babies.

I find it interesting that one must defend themselves for wanting to sleep at night once they have a baby! As a Mother of 8 month old twins, who was given the book as a gift and read it when they were almost 2 months old, have become a believer that my children are happier and more secure than others I am around that have not used Ezzo's method! I find that everyone asks what I have done to make the babies so good and content! I think it was hard work to follow this schedule at first and that must be why some people find it an unacceptable method! I must say when the babies were still very young I wished that some parts of the book would have been more explanitory,  but I now realize that is the beauty of Ezzo's method...It can fit to your lifestyle as you choose. You can be as strict or as flexible as need be. My children have NEVER cried more than 8 minutes to get to sleep, and that isn't very often! And even at 8 months they are the longest 8 minutes of my life, but the babies wake happy and ready to play! They were preemies and have thrived on this feeding schedule!  So I am confused as to why anyone would say it is unhealthy for a baby, except that maybe the parent rushed their child onto the next step before he was ready!  It took much longer for my preemie twins to sleep through the night, but that was o.k with me, as I wanted them to grow and thrive!! I recommend this method if you want content and secure children! This method teaches you, the parent, how to teach your baby to go to sleep without hours of walking the halls! It doesn't ever say, just let the baby cry all night either! It gives you the time to play and love your baby during the day, because the baby is on a schedule that you have designed to help him sleep through the night!  We are now reading Babywise II, and just as happy with the method!	2001-07-14	4

Some pediatricians see inadequate weight gain, dehydration, and failure to thrive among newborns on the program.&quot;  This book is so dangerous that Ezzo's editor, Jeff Gerke, was fired when he spoke out about the dangers of this book. The publishing house itself, Multnomah, has waffled in their opinion about Ezzo. Further, the American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement in April of 1998 about the dangers of this program.  LLL has also spoken out against Ezzo's titles.  Many, many of the customer reviews state that you need &quot;common sense&quot; to use this program, however, that contradicts the spirit of this book.  Ezzo does NOT advocate picking and choosing from this method.  In fact, he admonishes parents not to waiver from the program in any way.  To me, that's a BIG red flag.

The rigidity of scheduling suggested in Ezzo's book does not work well for every baby. Babbies are different, and inexperienced or insecure parents could easily endanger an infant if they become determined to stick to the harsh scheduling suggested by Ezzo. Any attempt to &quot;train&quot; a baby are sure to backfire, since babies are not pets to be trained - a baby will keep crying for attention if that attention is denied them, whereas a pet will go away eventually if ignored.<br />When a supposed childrearing &quot;professional&quot; suggests restraining a baby's hands when feeding them solid food, and then slapping their hands (at 6 months of age!) if they try to touch the food, I have to believe they know next to nothing about the needs of infants to experience their world through all five senses.<br />A baby is not an animal to be trained in basic hunger/sleep/play behavior by a parent. A baby needs parents who will respond to them, fulfill their needs, and make them feel loved and secure. Ezzo's methods meet none of these basic needs.<br />Do yourself and your baby a favor - trust your instincts, ask for help from family, doctors and friends, and DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!	2001-07-07	4

It took 2 days for her to completely get her nights and days mixed up! This continued for a month and our efforts to correct the problem failed. My mother-in-law purchased the book for us after a co-worker told her about it. I thank her every day!  My daughter is 5 months old and she is such a pleasure to be around. Everytime we take her out people always comment on what a happy child she is. She slept through the night at 2 month's and we haven't had any problems since.

The book, in my opinion, is meant as a guideline. I just put my 2 months old baby on the 3-hour schedule, as the book suggested. The result? A happier baby and a happier mom, too. The schedule makes sense for the baby because he needs a bit of structure. Before, he used to feed - snack would be more accurate - every hour and a half. Now, he eats better, sleeps better and smiles more! I now realize that babies actually NEED to cry sometimes. Even if it's still hard for me to let him cry it out (15-20 minutes is my personnal limit), after he goes to sleep, he wakes up rested and in a better mood. My boy sleeps about 5 and a half hours at night, which is a great improvement from his former 2 hours.	2001-06-27	4

A friend had recommended it, saying that it &quot;saved her life.&quot;  I suppose meaning that her baby was able to sleep through the night.  Being a new parent,  I of course was interested.  I began using Ezzo's strategies when my baby was 10 days old.  I thought that I should be in control; after all, I was the parent, right??  At six weeks I decided to allow my baby to &quot;cry it out.&quot;  in order to get him to sleep through the night.   I was so tired of always getting up with him.  I lay in bed rent with guilt for up to 45 minutes.  I could tell he was hungry, but the book had said that he would go back to sleep.  Then I would finally feed him.  I was breastfeeding too, so my milk was soaking through my night clothes while he cried.  Well, this went on for three nights and I finally decided that this &quot;method&quot; was not right for me.  Soon after, I began attending La Leche League meetings and met the most wonderful babies and mothers who gave me an entire new outlook on parenting.  Now, instead of dreading the time that I have to get up with my baby ( 5 mo. old), I look forward to the special time we can share together.<br />After doing my research, I have found that Ezzo has NO medical training and MANY doctors and lactation consultants STRONGLY DISCOURAGE Ezzo's methods.  It is dangerous for a mother's milk supply and to the baby's health.<br />Many Christian parents are given this book for &quot;Christian&quot; parenting.  I am a Christian and have found nothing in the Bible to support the method of ignoring your baby's needs.<br />I hope this review helps people to see the error in following Ezzo's ideas.	2001-06-20	4

I won't get into the medical issues, although the tenets of this book go against everything I know as a breastfeeding mother.

Concerned about wanting to do all the right things and at the right time in development BabyWise provided us a useful tool of knowledge.  When our baby starting sleeping thru the night at 3 weeks we felt like we had a program that was right for us.  The books disucssion of how to get your baby on a feeding and sleeping routine and the example suggestions on keeping your baby a wake after feedings instead of putting them down for a nap only make sense when you consider the energy you have after eating something yourself. (Provided that it is healthy and not full of sugar.) Having routine in a infants life is fundamental but the rewards outweight the hard work.  Our daughter is now three and we have continued to use the BabyWise philosohpy and she is still a good sleeper.   Also, the overall information in the book on when is best to start feeding solids, what kind to try first and helpful suggestions on potty training have answered a lot of our questions and reduced our fear of doing what is right and when. The over all philosphy of moral vs. morality is started in the early stages of life and we all hope as parents it is carried with our children as they grow and mature.  Babywise and the series of books following can assist in reducing the fear factor in parents.	2001-06-18	4

I have also been a first grade school teacher for 10 years and I see everyday the effects of unstructured home life on children.  I have put a lot of thought into how I want to raise my child and when I read this book it made so much sense to me.  Some of the previous reviews seemed to be saying that the book suggests neglecting your child.  This is not the case at all.  It supports doing whatever is best for your child at any given moment and in many different situations so that your child can grow to be confident and content.  I completely agree with teaching your child to be a part of a family team and giving them a purpose in life rather than teaching them that they are the center of the universe.  I know two mothers who use the methods from this book with their babies and both babies are very happy and well mannered.  If these methods were in any way neglectful or abusive, I don't think this would be the case.  Children need structure in their lives!  After reading this book, I feel much more confident that I will be a good parent.	2001-06-10	4

My experience in applying the principles of this book to a colicy baby were entirely different than the other reviewer's.  Life with my baby was a nightmare until I read this book.  As a first-time mom, it gave me a blueprint for how to deal with a life of chaos.  My baby's colic didn't go away, only time can accomplish that, however, Ezzo's schedule was actually soothing to my baby and seemed to minimize the pain she experienced.  Although her colic continued to 4 mos., she started sleeping through the night most nights at about 3 mos. and her total sleep-time during a 24 hour period doubled after reading this book.  (she slept only 10 hours total in a 24- hour period before reading this book) <br />Also, I would add that in my circle of friends, &quot;Baby-Wise&quot; mothers seem to lose their &quot;I-haven't-slept-in-20-years&quot; look months before the mothers who don't agree with the book and would rather let baby run the show.  Their children also seem to be happier and more well-adjusted overall.  Take it with a grain of salt and, of course, use common sense.  My husband and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have children and still have a life!	2001-06-05	4

It focuses on establishing optimum feeding/waking/sleeping cycles through attentive and sensitive response to your infants needs.  A Babywise parent listens to every cry the infant utters, assesses the situation, and intervenes appropriately understanding that there are many reasons why a baby cries and it is their duty to investigate and respond in a timely fashion.<br />I have followed all the principles in Babywise with my first born son who is now 5 months old.  My breastfed baby is THRIVING.  His growth in weight and length are off the charts.  Everyone who meets him comments on how happy and contented he is.  He began sleeping through the night at 2 months on his own with no coersion.  When I lay my baby down for a nap or for the night, he falls asleep on his own without crying and he wakes up cooing and happy.  Because my baby is well rested, he has not suffered any illnesses of any kind, even when my husband and I experienced the flu and colds.  Am I just lucky to have an &quot;easy&quot; baby?  The answer is NO.  We worked hard to research the issues, read and UNDERSTAND the principles set forth in Babywise, and implement them with all the loving care we are capable of, because we want the very best for our son.  Babywise principles are in complete harmony with AAP guidelines and do not contradict any recommendations my doctor has given me.  I am very thankful for the Babywise books and how they have helped me to cultivate a healthy, happy baby.	2001-05-30	4

This book is a GUIDE.  That's all.  As with everything, a little common sense goes a long way.  You shouldn't follow it down to the letter.  But that's the case with everything.  I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 because I don't think it is the best plan for breastfeeding.  But, if you are breastfeeding, this plan is the one I would work toward once you get your milk established.  I highly recommend the guidelines in this book.

At almost four months he is in the 75% for weight, and at a recent reunion of our birthing class he was the only baby not constantly crying (he was constantly smiling instead)and who was ahead in his milestones.<br />My son also had latching problems the first five weeks and this book was very supportive of whatever type of feeding our family chose.  Now that I am breastfeeding again, I find this book evermore helpful.<br />This book, like anything else, mandates common sense.  We have been VERY flexible with the program and have used it to fit our family's needs.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because I wanted to see more info on children nine weeks and older.<br />The friends that I have that continued to breastfeed throughout the first year all used Babywise and I can't thank them enough for recommending it.

After reading this book in two days-very easy reading, our lives really changed. We got onto the routine and it worked within a week. Our son was sleeping through the night-no more night time feedings and he had less gas because we were feeding him on a schedule rather than every time he cried. He also stopped spitting up so much. I look back now and the reasons for him spitting up and having gas was because we were feeding him too often too much.  We just have nothing but wonderful things to say about this book. I am pregnant with our second child, due in August and we plan to follow this book from day one. I strongly urge new parents to read and follow this book.  And for those of you who think that because you follow this book that you won't have a bond with your child-that's a JOKE!! My son is now 3 and he is the most loved little boy and he knows this.

I was looking for anything to help my baby.  I ideas in the book made sense to me and I thought they would work.  After weeks of trying to follow a schedule -- I thought the book.... well 'stunk'!  The only thing I agree with is Ezzo's statement that a baby with true colic has intestinal distress and that stretching out their feedings can give their gut a break.  I think this is true -- but these babies also need their needs met ASAP.  The more you let these babies cry, the more air they swallow, the less sleep they get and the more miserable they are.  If your colicy baby is asleep after they eat -- let them stay asleep!!  My baby would usually have tummy trouble a few hours after he ate -- about the time when this book recommends putting them to sleep.  As the day went on, it was only harder and harder for my baby to sleep.  I'm ashamed that I stuck with the program as long as I did.  Buy Dr. Sear's book 'The Fussy Baby and High Need Child'.  In my mind, babies (and children) are to be held and loved.  Giving them the security of knowing an adult will answer their cries only makes them better children later.	2001-05-14	4

As a mother of twins whose co-bedded twins fell into a schedule weeks before my girlfriends' babies of the same age, I have to say it was amazing to see this work for two different children who slept in the same crib.<br />The book doesn't instruct the parent to NOT feed the child if he or she is hungry (my twins fed more often b/c they were preemies and when they needed fed, they WERE) or to allow a child to wail for hours;  every instruction is issued on the PREMISE OF TEMPERANCE and balancing the implementation of the technique with the needs of the child.<br />Truth be told, we had three tough nights when there was crying, because the babies were not used to comforting themselves, but they learned it very quickly.  Let's not forget folks, babies cry--  they have for hundreds of centuries, and will assuredly cry a millenium from now--  crying ISN'T bad--  its the only way they can express any emotion they have.  We played music in their room throughout the day and night and we never had these  crying sessions, but again, all children are different.  <br />Frankly, I would much more rather deal with three tough nights and 17 months of peace (they are currently 18 months old), than children who sleep in Mommy's bed out of (bad) habit or cannot fall asleep without a bottle or other aids, wouldn't you agree?   This book helped us instill sound sleeping habits from birth, but as with any parenting technique, use common sense to temper what requires adjustment in your own home.	2001-05-10	4

I can't believe there are so many Mothers (and Fathers) reviewing this book as the &quot;antithesis&quot; of how NOT to raise your child.  They obviously have very poor reading comprehension if they think the authors of this book are suggesting you let your child &quot;cry it out for up to 45 minutes, even if they're hungry&quot;.  Give me a break!  This book not only helps you figure out a plan as a new parent, it reiterates the &quot;common sense&quot; we need in order to feel confident about BEING a new parent.  Putting your baby on a schedule just makes sense, as long as you follow the steps and listen to your baby.  My baby was on a 2.5 hour schedule and it helped me to plan my day so that I wasn't always feeling so frazzled.  I knew what to expect as a new mother and so did our baby.  Very little chaos and lots of time to enjoy our baby.  And believe me, our little guy is now 2.5 years old and VERY loved!  Those of you who think this book is telling you to forget your &quot;motherly instincts&quot; are being foolish.  If you can't read between the lines, you shouldn't read this book.  The structure in a family heirarchy SHOULD be parents as #1 and #2 and child as #3.  When your child leaves the nest at 18, will you have your spouse standing by your side?  That's up to you!

This book, in a nutshell, recommends arbitrarily setting a schedule for a newborn, and then forcing this helpless baby to stick to this schedule REGARDLESS of the infant's physiological needs.  The author attempts to back up his position with medical &quot;facts&quot;.  The majority of these facts are opinions that are not cited or referenced in any way.  In fact, most of the current research in this field goes completely against what this author purports, including the recent statement on breastfeeding by the American Academy of Pediatricians.  The author's recommendation for not feeding a hungry child is akin to recommending not changing a filthy diaper, because it's not diaper-changing time as stated in the schedule.  I am surprised the author doesn't recommend tying the infant in the crib to &quot;ensure the child learns that this is the proper place to sleep.&quot;  Honestly, if these methods were used on an older child, or an elderly person in a nursing home, the &quot;caretaker&quot; would be charged with criminal neglect.  However, this author thinks strict schedule imposition at all costs is perfectly ok to force on the most helpless of all creatures....a newborn child.  I hope parents use their god-given common sense before blindly following the cult-like herd who sing the praises of this cruel man!  I have two beautiful, happy healthy boys, and I would never dream of subjecting them to the methods in this book....the guilt would be overwhelming.	2001-05-07	4

Then you try to keep the baby awake--at first this will be only a few minutes, maybe just 2 or 3 minutes in a newborn.  Then, while the baby is still awake, lie him or her down to sleep.  The main idea is that you don't let the baby depend the breast or nipple to go to sleep--the baby learns to comfort and put herself to sleep.  The theory is that babies wake naturally every few hours.  With this method they have the skills to get themselves back to sleep without fully waking or waking you once, twice, three times each night.  <br />It REALLY works for most babies.  I'm sure there are some babies who just don't have the temperment for this, but it worked like a charm for my baby, and for all of my friends whom I've turned on to the book.  I have a five month old who sleeps 12 hours at a stretch without waking and has done so since she was 10 weeks old.  Not ONCE since she was 10 weeks old has she awoken in the middle of the night, and she wakes up in the morning so happy and calm it's hard to believe.  Often, she'll wake about 1/2 an hour before her usual waking time and &quot;sing&quot; and coo to herself in the crib.  When she sees me come into the room, she is grinning from ear to ear.  And despite the fact that she has just gone over 12 hours since the last feeding, she is not ravenously hungry in the morning--rarely finishes her very first bottle.  <br />The one drawback to this method is that it's hard for the baby to sleep anywhere but her own crib.  We don't go out much, but find that when we do, we can't stay out too long past the baby's bedtime because she won't just fall asleep in the carseat or our arms for more than a few minutes as our older daughter did.  She gets very cranky and tired, and seems so releived when we finally get home to her own crib.  She's also comfortable in her portacrib, so that she won't go bezerk when we travel--don't forget to factor this in!!!<br />That said, the critics are right when they say some of Ezzo's advice is stupid and dangerous.  Even though he claims his recommendations for a feeding schedule are flexible, they are actually very rigid, and an inexperienced parent who tries to rigidly adhere to them can end up causing dehydration in the baby.  I tell people I give the book to that they should try everything they can to make sure the baby takes as much as she can with each feeding, but if she can't go as long as Ezzo recommends between feedings just go ahead and feed sooner.  It still works fine.  <br />Also, it's ridiculous to let a newborn &quot;cry it out&quot; for more than just a few minutes.  My children have the uncanny knack of just escalating and escalating when any attempts are made in that direction.  So just be consistent.  If the baby seems to be getting more upset, go in and give comfort, and then start the routine to get the baby to sleep again.  I only had to do this for about 2 days to get my newborn to settle down for naps.  <br />Sometimes during the day, my newborn would cry for no apparent reason and be very upset.  My attempts to comfort her didn't work, so I'd put her in the crib to give myself a moment to calm down.  And the minute she'd hit the crib she'd smile and go right to sleep.  She was trying to tell me that she was tired and wanted to be in the place where she sleeps. <br /> Ezzo's idea to place the baby in the playpen or a baby seat in front of a window to amuse herself is pretty ridiculous for a young baby. Baboes aren't awake that much to begin with.  PLAY with him or her!!!! As your baby gets older, you can leave her in a safe position to play for a little while--but don't expect 45 minutes as Ezzo recommends.  When you're baby starts to express frustration, it's time to give your baby some attention.  <br />However, I don't agree with critics who say this method is incompatible with &quot;attachment parenting&quot;.  Nothing says you can't be very attached to your baby while letting her sleep in her own space--at least for naps and for most Americans at night too.  This baby sleeps so well and seems very secure and serene.  She is cuddly and happy to be in our arms, but just as happy to be put in her crib when she's tired.  When she's had enough rest, she is positively joyful (and so am I!!!).  When she's awake, I am with her, carrying her in a sling or front pack, playing with her on the floor, tickling her on the changing table--everything an &quot;attached&quot; parent would do.  But with this method the baby takes great naps so I get things done or a chance to rest myself, and we both have wonderful, restful nights.  <br />If you overlook some of the advice Ezzo gives, I think the basic premise is very good.	2001-04-25	4

It helped us to get our baby on a schedual and therefore made our lives slightly more sane. Our daughter is 10 weeks old and slept throught the night when she was 5 weeks old. I use this book and the book &quot;Secrets of the Baby Whisperer&quot; as references. Both have the same ideas as far as getting them on a schedual. &quot;Secrets of the Baby Whisperer&quot; says to go to the baby whenever she cries. &quot;On Becoming Babywise&quot; says to let them cry it out. I think there needs to be a happy medium between the two. That is why I say I use them both. Both agree that the baby should feed, play and then sleep. Neither tells what you are supposed to do if the baby falls asleep after a feed and you cannot get her to wake up.	2001-04-23	4
US	51274302	R3M3WNV5CPXWGL	1576734587	12194163	On Becoming Baby Wise	Books	5	5	9	N	N	Recommended by Pediatrician	Prior to the birth of my first child in 1999, I had heard of this book and I read the Amazon.com reviews, both for and against.  People either strongly loved it or severely hated it.  It made it difficult to make a decision, but not wanting to hurt my baby, I decided not to buy the book.  Imagine my surprise when our pediatrician, at a pre-birth educational session, suggested the PDF method discussed in Baby Wise.  He had been recommending it to his patients for 4 years, and had also used it for his own children.  He stated that of all of the children saw, he could always tell PDF babies because they were better behaved and happier.<br />You have to remember to keep the book in context, and use only what you want to use.  As first-time parents, I felt the book was good because it explained the child's natural sleep cycle.  Work with that, and your child will be happier.  Working against it will make it tougher on both of you.  I could understand that.  I don't like waking up in the middle of the night either!  But I knew my sleep cycle.  Before I read the book I didn't know what a baby's sleep cycle was.  (I find it interesting that now there are many stories on Dateline and 20/20 about how better/more sleep improves child behavior, intelligence, and learning.  Maybe Ezzo was a little ahead of his time there.)<br />The other helpful point for first-time parents made by the book is that babies cry for different reasons.  It's their only way to communicate!  So realize that crying doesn't always mean that they are hungry.  Are they wet?  Are they cold?  We learned to recognize different sounds, and it helped to save our sanity.  The worst thing to go through as a new parent is to have your child crying and you not knowing what to do.  The PDF method helps to minimize this.<br />Do I believe everything Ezzo says?  No.  But I didn't let that stop me from taking away and using the pieces of information that I did agree with.  Was I grateful for the help in understandingmy daughter's sleep cycle?  Absolutely.  My daughter did sleep through the night at 8 weeks, and yes, people always did comment that she was a happy baby, just like the book said they would.  Maybe it's her personality and the book had nothing to do with it.  Maybe not.  <br />My son will be born any day now, and I just re-read the book again.  He'll be a &quot;Baby Wise&quot; baby too, and I hope that he is as happy as my daughter is.	2001-04-23	4

When I showed this book to my pediatrician, he told me to return the book to the store I bought it from and try to forget every word of it.  Breastfed babies need to eat more frequently than Ezzo's harsh and rigid scheduling will allow.  <br />Newborn babies, especially breastfed babies, *need* to eat during the night.   And my pediatrician informed me that the American Academy of Pediatrics defines &quot;sleeping through the night&quot; as a five hour stretch of sleep.  <br />This book basically orders you to disregard the cries of your baby in order to make your life more convenient.  It's about priorities.  What is more important - that your baby is properly fed and comforted? Or that you get 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep?  Your baby is only a baby for a very short time, but you can get a good nights sleep for the rest of your life.  <br />Ask any pediatrician -- newborn babies do not cry in order to manipulate us.  They cry to communicate a need.   When you ignore their cries, you are teaching them that their needs will not be met.  That's sad. <br />There are much better sleep books out there that do not risk a baby's health and safety.  Ezzo's rigid feeding schedules fail to take into account an infant's changing nutritional needs due to growth spurts.  <br />For your baby's physical and emotional health, please don't buy this book.	2001-04-22	4

It didn't make sense to me, and I junked it. Thank God; a week later, I found out that the American Pediatric Society (a far more reputable voice than a theologian when it comes to my child) discourages the Babywise method. The infants that are being breastfed on a Babywise schedule can suffer from something called Failure to Thrive. This means that they are quietly starving. We moved on to other ways to parent. Yes, she nursed a lot in the beginning, but she grew, she nursed less, and I never had to force her to cry to prove that I am boss.

I was excited because my brother and his wife had already recommended it.  It was a great place to start from.  Until I read this book, I hadn't even thought about when to feed the baby, etc.  It has helped immensely!  Our daughter is now 5 weeks old and sleeping 5-6 hours a night--well on her way to sleeping 7-8 hours as she should in a few weeks.<br />The only thing I would  say is that while they give some help to adapt it to your own schedule, you should let the baby help determine her own regular schedule with your guidance.  They recommended no more than 3 1/2 hours from start of feeding to the start of the next, but my baby does better with four.  Nevertheless, I'm in charge of her schedule and can change it when necessary.<br />This book has saved my sanity of knowing how to start.  I have also referred to the chapter on what to do when she cries many times.  It is so wise to find the real reason behind the cry and not just assume it's always hunger--it usually isn't if she is well and regularly fed.<br />If you're having a baby, you need this book!!!  I'm buying it for my expecting friends!	2001-04-17	4

We read it and were able to apply its lessons one week later.  Alex started sleeping through the night after 10 weeks and he's the happiest kid I know.  I'm always telling my friends about this book.  I don't know what we would have done without it.  As a new mother, I truly appreciated the information and it was easy to understand.  Children aren't born with the knowledge to understand their needs. That's the parents job.  This book shares information from breastfeeding vs. bottlefeeding to how to keep your baby on a schedule which will work for your family.  It's not meant to be rigid or inflexible, it's meant to be used as a guideline from which to start.  You change and apply what you feel you need to for your baby.  I've also read the negative reviews on this book and feel that those people allow the baby to run their households and will only be raising an overindulged child and will be paying for it later.  My son is one year old now and we feel that he had the best start possible largely due to loving parents and this book.	2001-04-17	4

Our daughter was started on Babywise on day one and has been a gift to us and everyone around her.  She is very predicatable and extremely happy.  I kept this book and Babywise Two within arms reach and was constantly consulting the writing of Ezzo and Bucknam.  We have a happy 8 month old baby who has slept through the night since 9 weeks and takes two naps a day religiously. Her sleeping has not been affected by teething or illness.

I think it gave us a sense of control instead of craziness.  I felt like we were doing our baby a favor, nothing neglectful.  Our baby (our 3rd) wes noticeably calmer and more relaxed by the 2nd day of the program.  My only problem was in letting her cry it out for extended periods.  I did adapt in a suggestion from the baby whisperer book which was to pick her up when she became upset beyond the point of just fussing, soothe her only to the point until she stopped crying, them lay her down again. If I ever have to do this, I usually only have to pick her back up once or twice. I started babywise when she was 5 weeks, she's now 13 weeks and sleeping peacefully through the night.  I highly reccommend this book.	2001-03-26	4

We were told not to wake him up if he was sleeping.  Consequently, we didn't feed him enough because he slept too much at first.  Babies do not know what they need, it is our job as parents to supply their needs in appropriate quantities.  We did not read BabyWise until my son was a month old.  By this time we had gone through the first stage where he slept and did not eat, then he started eating all the time and I was nursing constantly.  I was a wreck.  When I read this book, I learned to put my son on a schedule.  This does not mean ignoring him or not responding to his needs.  It does mean taking the active role of a parent and supplying the babies needs without over supplying these needs.  After we started using this book our sons temperament changed to one of a happy baby who knew that he would be fed and taken care of.  Consequently, he did not have to fret and cry because he knew we were there for him.  He is now 16 months old and loves to go to bed and eats very well.  He is very healthy and was always a super chubby baby (even on a schedule).  This book did not make my life easier by letting me ignore my child.  In fact, it made it harder by having to stick to a schedule myself and find other methods of soothing the baby instead of sticking a bottle in his mouth.	2001-03-22	4

Prior to reading this book, I was attempting to follow the Sears school of attachment parenting and feeling miserable because I was failing on all fronts. I had a fussy baby that cried all the time and couldn't be comforted. I spent most of my day either praying he would go to sleep or parking him in the swing to try to calm him. By six weeks everytime he'd wake up crying, I'd start crying because I felt like I couldn't face it anymore.  After starting Babywise at 7 weeks, within 10 days my baby slept 8 hours straight, with another 4 after the feeding.  Now we're getting enough sleep.  The bigger bonus is that he takes regular naps and his wake time is spent smiling and cooing rather than crying!  Contrary to many reviews you may read, this book is not about ignoring a crying baby.  By putting him on a schedule, you learn to tell the difference between a hungry cry, a sleepy cry, a painful cry ....and you can respond appropriately, which is much more important than just responding. I can now plan my day around the baby's schedule, get things done, and I have more time left to play with my baby.  My baby cries less and I don't cry at all!!  I must admit when I first read the book I was hesitant to try the recommendations because it was so diametrically opposed to what I had been doing.  But since what I was doing wasn't working, I took the chance - - and am still reaping the benefits!  I also recommend the Baby Whisperer book which gives good information on how to interpret babies' body language - really good for first time Moms.	2001-03-18	4

Before reading it, I was nursing every 1-1.5 hours and we were all exhausted.<br />After reading the book on the recommendation of some friends, we found that by following the eat-wake-sleep cyle, instead of what we were doing (eat-sleep-eat-sleep), our baby is now happier, more rested, and more interactive.  By making sure she got a full feeding instead of letting her &quot;snack,&quot; I noticed a big difference in how satisfied she was. We decided to try this method for two weeks, and it only took three days for her to sleep 6 hours during the night.  The improvement in her disposition was overnight.  This worked well for us, and people who have seen us before and after have remarked on the difference.  Strangers come up to us and tell us how lucky we are to have such a happy baby.<br />I also learned to tune into our daughter's various cries and not just feed her every time she made a sound.  This, too, helped me respond to her needs in an appropriate way.<br />I pick and choose what works for us, always keeping our baby's best interest in mind, and let the results dictate what we do next.  If it doesn't work for our family, we seek out what does.	2001-03-14	4

This book has the most practical, common sense advice I have read on how to put a baby on a feeding/sleeping schedule. This book clearly explains the importance of stabilizing your baby's metabolism from the 1st week by ensuring the baby is eating at regular intervals.  Helpful scheduling charts are included in the back of the book.  It also gives wonderful advice on how to get your baby to sleep through the night.  I wish I had read this book with my first baby.  My first baby had difficulty gaining weight, after reading this book I know it was because I let my baby nurse whenever she cried (whether she was crying from hunger or something else), thus she was snacking and not getting full feedings. With my next baby due to be born in a couple of weeks, I feel much more confident on how to get him on a schedule by using the advice found in this book.  Also, this book makes an excellent gift for new moms.  I include a copy of this book as a gift to my friends at their baby showers!	2001-03-13	4
US	52564577	R3K8WEX3LJZMSV	1576734587	12194163	On Becoming Baby Wise	Books	1	105	137	N	N	Poorly researched, alarmist and divisive	This 1998 edition of Babywise is Gary Ezzo's second attempt to get it right  (The earlier edition was just published in 1995).  This edition vastly improves on the scant research of the first edition.  In the 1995 edition, Ezzo provides only 10 footnotes in the entire book.  Of these, only two medical research articles are mentioned -- one from 1982 and another from 1986.   Neither of these articles are relevant to Ezzo's case for &quot;Parent-Directed Feeding&quot; or getting the newborn to &quot;sleep through the night  by 8 weeks&quot;.  The newer edition does much better  -- with at least 30 footnotes that includes more current sources.  One interesting change in the updated edition:  Ezzo revises his expectations for getting newborns to &quot;sleep through the night&quot; from 5-8 weeks (1995 edition) to 7-9 weeks.<br />Although this edition is much improved, Ezzo persists with same pattern of fallacious reasoning and divisive tone that plagued his first edition.  Ezzo also seems to be subconsciously aware that some of his views are not supported by conventional medical research.  His quote on page 39 is very telling:  <br />&quot;The best evaluation of any parenting philosophy, including Babywise, is not found in the reasoning or the logic of the hypothesis.  End results speak clearly.  Let your eyes confirm what works and what doesn't&quot;<br />Ezzo supporters seem to echo this same mentality --- dismissing concerns from the American Academy of Pediatrics and other credible sources with the defense:  &quot;It just works!  We got our baby to sleep through the night by 5 weeks. Don't judge the book until you try it for yourself!&quot;   But two things ought to be said this:   First, this kind of logic falls prey to what is known as the &quot;pragmatic fallacy&quot;  --  that is, the notion that &quot;if something works -- it must be right&quot;.   However, when we say something &quot;works&quot;, all that means is that a certain set of results were achieved from a certain set of expectations.  But this says nothing about whether the expectations themselves are realistic, appropriate, medically sound or even safe!   Secondly, while many parents in fact report success with the Ezzo method and have healthy and thriving babies, these anecdotal success stories alone do not merit adopting the PDF method as a standard practice -- especially when a wide body of medical research seems to caution otherwise.  The Ezzo program may work well for many families whose pre-conditions are already compatible with scheduled feedings.  But it is NOT clear it works for everyone -- as Ezzo thinks it should.<br />This book raises a great deal of red-flags, and new parents should be asking a lot of questions (especially from respected medical or family-advocate sources) before jumping head-first into this book.   For starters, I would suggest writing or emailing the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, The La Leche League, The Christian Research Institute or Focus on the Family.	2001-02-28	4

We read the book and then left it for several months until after I devivered.  We then re-read it and started putting Ezzo's practices into place.  It really worked! Within 7 weeks both of our babies were sleeping through the night and are really happy, attentive babies.   I have heard that the organization behind &quot;BabyWise&quot; is quite controverisal and have heard alot of negative things about the program. From what I have been able to learn through the internet I would not be interested in that program.  &quot;BabyWise&quot; is part of their outreach ministry and I found it was terrific.

It was given to us with the birth of our first child and we didn't read through it until our child was about three months old. My husband and I implemented the suggested schedule and our child was sleeping through the night within three days. We don't agree with everything they suggest, but have followed most of it with much success. It's like any other parental advice, use what works for you. Our child is very happy and secure, sleeps twelve hours at night and naps during the day without protest. It's about teaching your child self control, how to go to sleep without you, and that food isn't the answer to everything. Children function best on a schedule, they actually gain security from it.  We wish our sleep deprived friends would give this a try.	2001-02-22	4

You'll think you have a plan, are ready, and have your handbook.  Not so fast!  This book could be dangerous, and the experts agree.  It does have good advise about making the parents' relationship the center of the family (not the child) and about getting your baby on a schedule.  However, it demands that you supress your instinct to go to your baby if he/she seems in pain or otherwise needs comfort.  It goes as far as calling you weak if you go to comfort her.  This is a bit drastic.  If that baby needs you and you feel the need to go to her, you go!  She could be scared or gassy, not just manipulative.  We don't need this guy making us feel guilty for going in.  My 2 kids have been sleeping through the night since 10-12 weeks old and still are at 3 and 1 year old.  Get a book that helps you, not supresses your instincts.  Pass on this one.	2001-02-15	4

AS others have stressed, the American Academy of Pediatrics has issued a warning on this book's feeding schedules.  Especially if you are breastfeeding, baby will not thrive if you go 3 hours between feeds.  from a lot of the testimonials, citing success with 5 to 8 week old babies on sleep, about 6 weeks is when mom's baby blues wear off.  That is also when your milk supply is more established and baby automatically went longer 2 to 21/2 hours between feeds.  What about baby's growth spurts and bringing up my milk supply if I don't feed him on demand?  Why would one go totally against nature?<br />I like all of the Sears books, though I would say follow your own common sense and instincts with any book.  This book is not baby-wise, it promotes selfish parenting! My baby just turned 7 months, and sure, our and esp. my stay-at-home-mom life is centered around him, but his is centered around us too, and everyone comments on how &quot;easy&quot; he is, that is because he knows that if he really wants me, i've never kept him waiting more than 30 seconds before I respond to him.  Frankly, maybe its because of the breastfeeding, I can't bear to not respond to him. He is very secure, and happy to explore his surroundings by himself for 15 to 20 minutes at a time while I do other stuff.  He cries for all of 2 minutes a day,  fusses for maybe 20 minutes and is developing on schedule and growing off the charts on every statistic!<br />Around 3 1/2 months, he started sleeping many nights for upto 6 hours. Around 5 months, he automatically matured enough to want to go upto 3-4 hours(especially with his 2 hour afternoon and evening  naps) between some feeds without complaint, and  yes, it is good to teach them to fall asleep on their own. You can do that with no tears! And yes, set limits,a simple one he learned within a couple of days at 4 months is not to bite/teethe while feeding :-)	2001-02-14	4

In that respect I agree with this book's message.  I must say that as a health care professional there are a few concepts mentioned in this book that make normal feeding and growth patterns difficult to follow.  Exclusively breast fed babies have feeding patterns that are called &quot;cluster&quot; feedings.  Cluster feedings occur during the first few days of life and at every growth spurt.  A cluster feeding is characterized by several (2 to 3) small &quot;meals&quot; within a 1 to 2 hour time frame followed by a 1 to 2 hour sleeping or wakeful period.  Many families that are trying to exclusively breast feed become frustrated when the baby won't get on a &quot;schedule&quot; when really the baby has his or her own feeding schedule that's normal for his or her growth requirements at the time, it just may not follow a clock.  Exclusive breast feeding is what is normal and best, and for a family to succesfully achieve an exclusively breast milk diet for thier little one, a cyclical eat-play-sleep program may not be effective.  Babies have an innate drive to get their needs met if we listen they will show us what they need.	2001-02-11	4

A friend had mentioned Babywise to me when my baby was only a week old, but I thought I had all the answers!  I wanted to co-sleep with my baby and feed her on demand.  That's what all the &quot;experts&quot; had recommended.(including the lactation consultants at the hospital--although my baby was put on a 3 hour schedule by the hospital staff!)  <br />By the time my baby was 4 weeks old, I was exhausted and depressed!  I wasn't getting any sleep and my baby cried day and night.  She wanted to nurse at least every hour on the hour, and she didn't sleep at all during the night.  I was ready to quit breastfeeding because I was feeding her all day long!  After spending 4 HOURS feeding, rocking, walking, and &quot;cuddling&quot; my baby in the middle of the night, I knew there just had to be another way!  I was so tired and so depressed and my baby cried so much that I didn't even want to be a mother anymore!  We were desperate to try anything!  <br />When we read Babywise, the biggest thing we changed right away was trying to keep our baby awake after feeding her.  She didn't have to cry herself to sleep for more than 10 minutes because she went down for her naps after playing and when she was tired!  Within a couple of days, we had a new life!  Mom, Dad, and baby were getting much needed rest, and we were all much happier.  I had a better idea of how often I should feed my baby and help her take naps.  She ate better because she was hungrier and more rested.  Before Babywise, she only nursed for a couple of minutes every so often, so she was never getting the much needed &quot;hindmilk&quot;!  After Babywise, she started to gain weight even though she was eating less often!  Since then, people have always commented on how alert and happy our baby is!  I know it's because of the techniques we used from this book!  <br />I have several friends who have chosen to co-sleep with their babies.  Some of them still sleep with their 2 and 3 year old children because their children are unable to sleep in their own beds.  Others have eventually been forced to let their babies &quot;cry it out&quot; for up to 2 hours!  I don't see how the gift of sleep can ever be considered cruel or harsh.  Forcing a child to become totally dependent on a parent for their sleep seems less desirable.	2001-02-07	4

(Because when you come down to it, you ARE raising future adults.)  We as a society need to desparately teach our children loving discipline.  We give our children limits to show our children that we care about them as individuals.  There are limits and laws in every aspect of our lives, religious and secular.  The sooner we learn about limits and the consequences for breaking them, the better.  It is more HUMANE to learn this lesson early, then when the results are more dire.  The Ezzo's, at no point in this book, recommend neglecting your child.  ANY resonable person, who has read the book, would deduce the same.  In response to other books denoucing this method of child raising,  I say this:  You can find any book saying exactly what you want to hear if you look long enough.  My children are babywise babies and complete successes.  Straights A's at one of the top schools in the nation, loving adult males with a moral and social conscience and very spiritual people.  I've had many people approach me from the time they were infants, envying my relationship with my boys and the lovely temperment they have.  Teachers have asked me to help them with their classes because of our repor and their exceptional performance.  The Ezzos and Dr. Bucknam provide GUIDELINES which you must temper with wisdom.  To blindly follow any book to the T would be irresponsible parenting and just plain stupid.  These are children NOT RECIPES!  And to all those raising 'Child-centered' children:  I've met their predecessors and they are the most self-absored, ego-centric people you'd never want to know.   And the AMA is NOT the foremost authority on what is best for your child.    The AMA is a non-profit organization made up of physician, most are not pediatricians.  They &quot;recommend&quot; a lot of things, your job as a parent is to research and make your OWN decision.  Not all their &quot;recommendation&quot; have been good (IE: Phen-Fen). Good Luck to future parents trying to make  rational, sound, parenting decision.  It would be hard to find a better book than this.	2001-02-07	4

I wish I'd read some customer reviews, first!!  After a few pages of reading in this book I began to feel very guilty about the sleep patterns of my first child.  We had let him sleep in bed with us for a while, and at 19 months he still needs us for comfort as he falls asleep at night.  This might not be ideal, but I don't think my child is on his way to an undisciplined life of confusion.  Please read up on Ezzo before you read this book.  I think he offers an interesting perspective, and I'd like to try a (very) few of his suggestions, but I want to read a lot more before I try anything.  It's hard for me to praise an author who contradicts himself and talks of flexibility and strictness going hand-in-hand.  Babies do need routine and schedules and predictbability, but they also need attention and love.  Sure, I'd love to get my kids to fall into line and follow my own personal schedule, but I know that parenting involves sacrifices and I'm willing to make them.  And I'm NOT sacrificing my relationship with my husband because of that.  I urge readers to take Ezzo's information lightly and read more than just this one book.	2001-02-02	4

We found out we were having twins when I was 3 months pregnant.  We stepped up our search for parenting books at that point. We knew we were really going to need help.  My twins came two months early and spent 1 month in the hospital.  When they came home they were still 1 month early.  Because they were still so early we waited until they reached their due date to start using the advice in Babywise.  We were losing our minds with all the night-time feedings and knew once they got big enough that was going to have to change. When they finally got big enough we made the gradual switch to no more night-time feedings and it was easy.  They are now 3 months adjusted age old and have been sleeping through the night for over a month. They are happy when they get up in the morning and spend alot of good alert learning time.  It has made all of the difference in the world.  I also liked that it stressed that your relationship with your spouse is extremely important and as a mother you shouldn't focus your life around your child to the exclusion of your spouse.  I have already purchased book two and read it.  There is alot of common sense stuff in there that I plan on using.

From personal experience, I can tell you that &quot;child-centerd parenting&quot; works wonders.  While all of my friends who had babies at the same time as I were telling me horror stories of guilt, shame, and worry over ignoring their babies cries so that they would &quot;learn&quot; to sleep, the question/concern of &quot;sleeping through the night&quot; WAS NOT EVEN AN ISSUE THAT I THOUGHT OF.  That's right.  My baby slept with me, and night-waking was not an issue.  It is also more practical to roll over and nurse a baby than to get up, go into another room, and feed a child.  (One would think that less-stressed, less-tired parents would be less prone to being abusive and short with their children too!)  In addition, the idea of scheduling feeding that the authors promote is ludicrous!  (Please also notice that the authors of the book are MALES,who, by way of nature, are not &quot;equipped&quot; to feed infants anyhow, and who's main reading audience is women, who mostly care for children, how to parent.  I am NOT EVEN a feminist, but books on childcare written to women by men is as ridiculous as male gynecologists in my book.  Think about it.)  Contrary to the book, babies are more content when fed when hungry (wouldn't you be?).  Contrary to the book's proposal that &quot;child-centered child-rearing&quot; brings up demanding, bratty toddlers, children who are cared for and loved (but who also have limits) are more respectful and willing to comply with adult/parent authority. (Studies have actually confirmed this.) I define limits RATIONALLY, you know, not letting the kid draw on the walls, not letting the kid yell, etc., NOT by isolating the child at night or by scheduling feedings.  Also, studies have shown that caressing, hugs, kisses, etc. are good for and stimulate baby's grown.  In addition, studies have shown that sleeping with your child will 1.) help start/keep a regular breating pattern for infants,and 2.) coordinate parent/child sleep cycles.  Aslo, studies have shown that stress increases one's risk of becoming ill (stress hormones are bad for the immune system.)  So the decision is, let your child cry it out, be insecure, learn that mommy and daddy won't come and meet their needs (they are NOT big planners, manipulaters, or thinkers at this age...talk to a three-year old, even, they aren't much of one by that age, either...),and be stressed, or look for signs of hunger, squirmyness, rooting, grimacing face, etc. BEFORE the baby starts to cry, and teach the child that they are secure, taken care of, loved, and keep their anxiety level down.  Now, for a great book on why to parent &quot;child-centered&quot;, read OUR BABIES, OURSELVES by MEREDITH SMALL.  Also read MOTHER AND CHILD by JAN REYNOLDS.  Other good books are THE BABY BOOK by DR. AND MARTH SEARS as well as THE FAMILY BED by T. THEVENIN and TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR CHILD'S HEALTH by DR. WOOTAN.  These books are highly informative, and will give you a great perspective as to why it is BIOLOGICALLY/EVOLUTIONARILY smart to use &quot;child-centered&quot; child-rearing.  Baby Wise is interesting, and again, I'm sure the tecnique works (the authors went on enough about how it did/does), but HOW and WHY it works aught to be considered, too.  The consequences of such child-rearing may not be the price you want to pay for a good night's sleep.  (Which your would get anyway if your baby slept in your bed.)  BTW, the above books mentioned will give you a good idea of infant sleep cycles, and why they are the way they are.  (Also read NIGHT TIME PARENTING by DR. SEARS for more info on sleep cycles.)	2001-01-28	4

The only complaint I have about the book is that they are pretty vague about how the schedule should change as the baby gets older.  I guess by that time they should be sleeping through the night so it's not such a big deal.  I am a true beleiver in the Baby Wise schedule and will continue to recommend this book to family and friends.	2001-01-18	4

At 8 weeks old, our baby was waking every hour and a half; we were tired but we were putting up with it. Then when our pediatrician asked us if we were feeding the baby in order to put him to sleep, and we admitted that we were. She said there's a better way and she recommended On Becoming Baby Wise. She warned us that it is a contoversial approach but since we trust her, we followed the book by the letter. IT WORKS! I love this book. It saved our life. At 2 month old we started the training, and now, at 5 months, our baby is remarkably easy going - he puts himself to sleep (for naps and through the night) effortlessly.  We are so greatful and highly recommend this book.	2001-01-18	4

I wanted to be close to my child.  But, after 3 weeks, I was still in my robe at noon, was crying all the time with baby blues, I could not get my life together, and my baby ended up with colic.  I could not handle it anymore.  I then read Baby Wise one day while holding my baby so he would not cry.  Within 24 hours I had a new baby.  He is happy, the colic is gone (I was over feeding my baby and feeding him to sleep), and at 4 weeks old he is only getting up 1 time in the middle of the night. I will be returning to work in a few weeks and I have total confidence that our son will be sleeping the night through.  Furthermore, this book is not just for sleeping through the night, our baby is very happy now during the day, something we did not have earlier.<br />As for &quot;crying it out&quot; start it during the day, my baby only cried for 10 minutes. As for bedtime, put the child to bed at 9:30/10:00 so they cry it out before you go to sleep.  At this point my son only cries about 30% of the time for only about 5-10 minutes and now while he is awake he is a very happy baby unlike before.  <br />If anything read both books like I did and make the decision for your self I'm sure you will find your self in the same place I was, leaving \\"Attachment Parenting\\" and become \\"Baby Wise\\"	2001-01-16	4

I do not recommend this book because it is the antithesis of every motherly instinct within me. Mr. Ezzo recommends things such as letting your baby &quot;cry it out&quot; for up to 45 min. even if he is hungry simply because it is &quot;not time&quot; (per a superfluous schedule) to eat. As a new mother, it chills me to think so many people are following the Ezzo's suggestions. Before purchasing this or any of the Ezzo books, I recommend looking online at various theories and beliefs of the Ezzo's re: how to raise children (i.e. using more-than-simply-a-firm hand)--get out of the 30's and 40's!	2001-01-15	4
US	51223237	R2NXZ1PVXYJRQR	1576734587	12194163	On Becoming Baby Wise	Books	5	4	8	N	N	Excellent Resource	We began using this book when out daughter was 10 weeks old.  Until then, we have been demand-feeding and not putting her down for naps on a regular schedule.  We had also just return from a very busy three week vacation to visit family and friends.  We began a schedule on the first Monday after our return and saw results in two days!  Our daughter was very receptive to a schedule and cried for 15 minutes at the most when we would put her down for a nap.  It is now the end of our first week and she goes down for naps and at night with no fuss at all.  She has even learned to entertain herself in her crib by talking or sucking her thumb until she falls asleep.  She is still not sleeping through the night, but she is waking only once.  As a result, we have a much happier, fun-to-be-around baby and we are much happier, calmer parents.  We are able to get things done for ourselves now and for her.  And have quality time with her when she is awake!<br />Nowhere does this book advocate not feeding your child when they are hungry or letting them cry it out.  In fact, the book mentions not letting an infant cry for more than 20 minutes and to feed them when they show signs of hunger.  You still have to trust your instincts and do what is best for your baby.  Our baby rarely cries now and we now know how to recognize why and when she is getting cranky because she needs to go to bed.  This book has made a huge impact on our lives as new parents while allowing us the flexibility to enjoy our baby and ourselves!d maybe not-so-early) weeks.  That's part of parenthood. But as adults, we hopefully can see that the day-to-day difficulties are more than outweighed by the joy and satisfaction of raising a child, meeting their needs as THEY convey them to US, not vice versa. Please just listen to your baby, not the advice in this book.  All it is giving you is permission to be less of a parent than you ought to be.	2001-01-12	4

I tried the schedule and it worked so well that my child cried a lot during the day from hunger and woke every 3 hours at night for over a year.  I finally went to demand feeding which solved the daytime problems completely, but he still stuck to his schedule at night.  He still has problems sleeping at 2 1/2.  My new baby, now 3 months old, was demand fed from birth and is now sleeping for 9 hours at night.  It just doesn't make sense that feeding on a schedule during the day would translate to no feedings at night.  <br />On a more positive note, it did work well to let the baby teach himself to go to sleep.  This has been wonderful.  I put them down (my toddler now has a routine 1st) and they go to sleep.  <br />Generally, this book is not one I would recommend.  You can figure out the things you need to know by common sense.	2001-01-12	4

The book seems to contradict itself in many places.<br />The schedule is great.  Even many adults (maybe not all) thrive on a schedule.  Waking up your baby during the day and letting the baby wake you up at night allows your baby to tell night from day (this was recommended by a lactation nurse at the hospital). Also, you catch the baby before he/she is extremely and  uncomfortably hungry when you use a schedule.  <br />But use your head, not the clock (even the book says this).  If your baby is hungry, feed him or her.  It seems like some babies may need to feed every 2 to 2 1/2 hours and not 2 1/2 to 3 like the book recommends.  Like the nurse at the pediatrician's office told me - it doesn't do anyone any good to constantly nurse the baby every hour.<br />Another idea that is helpful is to avoid &quot;sleep props&quot;.  I believe that, from day one, my job as a parent is to teach my child independence.  This doesn't mean that I prefer that she not need me, but she needs me to teach her, to love her, and to give her the security and self confidence to be indepenent.  At a young age, independence means teaching her to put herself to sleep instead of depending on a sleep prop like the swing, rocking, and nursing.  This also helps me as a parent.  I am less stressed and better rested because she doesn't depend on me to get to sleep.<br />The pattern of eat, waketime, and sleeptime also seems to be helpful, although I am unsure if it is as critical as the schedule and avoidance of sleep props.  It does seem to help stretch feeding times if the last thing that the baby does is sleep.  <br />In the end, USE YOUR BRAIN.  Like EVERYTHING ELSE you read, pull from this book what works for you.	2001-01-08	4

We purchased Babywise when she was 5 weeks old (and we were extremely exhausted from waking up several times at night with a newborn who would only nurse for a couple of minutes before falling asleep for another hour or so).<br /> After establishing a daily routine for her as the book suggests, and helping her to eat well at her nursings instead of just snacking, we saw a huge improvement in her sleep habits. By the time she was 7 weeks old, she was sleeping 8 hours straight at night and became a very easy-going baby in the day.<br />We continued using the methods in this book and her sleep contined to surprise our friends (who's baby's were not sleeping so well). Another wonderful bonus is how easy going and well mannered our daughter is because of using the Ezzo materials. She's just a toddler and we constantly get compliments from others about her sweet nature and her good sleep habits (she actually LIKES to go down for naps and bedtime verses fighting it). I highly recommend this book to other parents. It made a world of difference for us - and we are now using it again with our 6 week old son. :)<br /> As a mother of two young children now, I really think this book has made it possible for me to manage my home the best way I can. I'm able to still take showers, cook meals and spend time with my husband while caring for the needs of my two little ones. It's been a huge blessing to me (and the methods really aren't magical - they are just practical ways that parents have trained their kids for a long time). Just ask your grandparents (who probably had a houseful of kids) how they did it.	2001-01-08	4

I found the book EXTREMELY helpful, and would recommend it to anyone.  Use some common sense when reading it.  It is NOT child abuse.  I found it to be a very healthy method, when used correctly.  Our daughter is now 2 and naps and goes to bed for the night most times without a peep.  Use the book to fit your life style.  If you are uncomfortable with some of the suggestions, don't use those particular ones.  Overall, the book is WONDERFUL and a god-send.  I only wish I had read it earlier.  After establishing a FLEXIBLE (and I stress FLEXIBLE.  No where in the book do they order you to be a tyrant!) schedule, our lives changed enormously.  It was like night and day.  We were better able to interpret our child's needs, and were able to pacify the cry, based on what we learned in Babywise.  Babywise is beneficial for baby and parents alike.  I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone that has the ability to read it with an open mind, and who can use it to fit their lifestyles.	2001-01-07	4

I find it hard to believe that God would let his child cry to the point of exhaustion just to fit his schedule or let his child go hungry because it was not time to eat yet. I don't know any adult that could follow this &quot;Babywise&quot; schedule, how can we expect our children to. I would hope that parents research fully any method of parenting that they choose, following your natural instincts would be my suggestion. Babywise is a way to TRAIN your baby, it's pretty sad that we are training babies in the 21st century. Babies cry because they are hungry, wet, tired, or just need love. We need to stop treating our children as an inconvenience. I have researched this method and the effects on children parented this way. I understand that every parent uses this method differently but for those that stick to it 100% and do not listen to their babies needs, you are causing your child a lifetime of detachment, and emotional and psychological problems.

No where in the book does Ezzo say to let your baby remain hungry. He actually says to go ahead and feed your child. I agree that it may seem harsh at first, but it benfits the baby greatly. What are you teaching your child if you feed them every time they cry. They will seek comfort in food for a lifetime. I did not go full force because I couldn't stand to hear my baby cry for long. I checked in on him every five minutes. He still learned to go to sleep on his own. I have to asked myself if all the people against this book can say that. It changed my life, along with my sisters, who also used this method. I'm a much happier parent and can now give the maxium love and energy necessary to raise my son.	2000-12-31	4

It tells them what to do so they don't learn to trust their own instincts.  Or tells them their instincts are wrong.  This whole book is about how to make a baby fit your schedule rather than helping people realize a baby is a life changing event.  It talks about training rather than allowing the child to experience the world.  It also doesn't allow for developmentally appropriate behaviour.  It's ridicules to think a 6  or 7 month old baby should sit in a high chair and not play with/experiment with food.  In a nutshell I think this baak takes all the power away from the parent so then they depend on someone else to tell them how to raise their own child.  It creats an independence on the authors.  Run screaming from this book.  Throw it away so no one else can pick it up at your garage sale.	2000-12-28	4

He was very colicky and crying much of the time anyways; funny, that didn't put him to sleep. Ezzo suggests NOT rocking your child to sleep and not letting him fall asleep while eating.

I would like to publicly apologize anyone I might have encouraged to use the Ezzo methods while I participated in some of their classes.  In our Ezzo classes at church, we were told repeatedly that the Ezzo methods were God's Way, yes, with a captial G, and that only Ezzo parenting was the Right Way. We were also told that parents who DIDN'T use the Ezzo parenting methods, including attachment parents, would have spoiled, self-centered children. The Ezzos include fictional descriptions of children in their books and course materials, showing a child raised on THEIR methods as being a perfect little angel, and the child NOT raised on their methods as the one who pushes little kids off swings and having no consideration for others.<br />I have two daughters, a pre-teen and an elementary school child.. With the first I got into an Ezzo-type schedule, only nursed for a short time, pushed her into a crib and then into a toddler bed before she was ready. I tried to maintain this level of &quot;deattachment&quot;  and schedule with my second child. How I wish I could have known then what I know now. My duaghters would have benefited from less emphasis on schedule and more empahsis on loving interaction.<br />We finally took Ezzo classes at church out of desperation and were TOLD they were completely practical, non-dangerous, and a life-saver. Instead of the techniques improving our relationship with our daughters (especially our oldest), our relationship suffered. It was after this happened that we started researching the Ezzos on the net, and we were shocked to find they had so little foundation for their teachings. We were shocked that we were so gullible to beleive that this was &quot;biblical parenting&quot; and God's Way to raise our children. Ezzo has primarily antedotial evidence ONLY that his methods work, coming from people who have bought into the belief that his is the &quot;biblical&quot; way to parent. He is not well-versed in what is normal child development.His wife was a nurse for a very brief period of time MANY years ago. Dr Buckman had only peen a practicing pediatrician for a year or two when the first Babywise book came out with HIS name on it as a &quot;leading pediatrician.&quot;<br />Unlike some people who believe others blast this book out of hand, I have actually read a lot of the Ezzo's work, both the secular ____wise titles and their church materials. I know what I am talking about. <br />I heartily recommend that new or experienced parents of an infant do their research about child development and what is best for their childen before launching into the world of Ezzoism.<br />For the parent who would like to raise a well-behaved and thoughtful child, you don't need the Ezzo methods to achieve this. Babies will achieve a routine and eventually sleep through the night. They have been doing so since time began. You don't NEED Babywise to accomplish this.	2000-12-27	4

To my mind, the principles that are given in the book make perfect sense. A baby, like most other people, is comforted by structure and predictability and limits, and is not comforted by the fact that he has two cranky servants at his beck and call.<br /> Our baby began sleeping through the night when he was several weeks old, and has constantly been praised ever since for appearing to be such a happy, pleasant baby.  In turn, we have become happy, pleasant, and well-rested parents. <br />In contrast, the parents we know who subscribe to demand feeding often appear haggard and stressed, with a squalling brat slung around the mother's neck who she and dad are ever straining to pacify.  Predictions are hazardous, but I can't help but think that 15 years from now those children will still be squalling, in one way or another, and those parents will still be straining to pacify them.	2000-12-22	4

We have used this book with our now 18 month old son and plan to use it with our new baby daughter when she arrives. It works; our son thrived on the schedule - emotionally, physically and sleep-wise. <br />My son did have colic for the first 10 to 12 weeks and I was flexible and didn't follow the book to a tee until this was over.  This was the way to go since he had valid issues (gas, etc.) that were keeping him from easily following a schedule. But, once this went away he immediately got on to the schedule and was sleeping through the night &amp; eating and napping at the same time on a regular basis. It was wonderful and it was all because of the guidelines that I followed from the book.  I think some people give up on the book or become negative if their child has colic, but I strongly suggest to be flexible as we were and incorporate the principles of this book as the colic goes away.<br />Also, I hear many untrue statements about the Ezzos.  You can read about them on their gfi.org. webpage.  He is a pastor and his wife is a nurse.  They also have six grandchildren.  I feel everyone has a right to their opinion, but to be so negative and spread info that is just untrue is a going a little overboard.<br />As another review said, I'm also amused at the &quot;controversy&quot; over this book and the attacks from the Attachment Parenting camp and the accusations of &quot;child-abuse&quot;. I have a son that is happy, well-rested, gets all the love &amp; nurturing that he needs. If you're a parent, I believe Baby Wise is a must-read!	2000-12-21	4

This is a useful book for those new parents who have received lots of conflicting advice, read other baby books and want to round out their perspective on child rearing. I had already read the Dr.Sears 'Attachment Parenting' book and found the Babywise book helpful in terms of recognising that there are all sorts of different parenting styles out there (each, by the way, professed to be right by the 'experts'). Once you meet your little baby, you will find out which works best for you!  <br />Overall, I found parts of the book very practical, particularly working to get your child on a flexible schedule. This way, you know that when baby is crying it is not likely to be due to hunger (understanding baby's cries is pretty tough at first!) And, it is amazing just how quickly and painlessly your baby can get onto a schedule.  Other parts however, need to be taken with a grain of salt and adjusted to your individual style - particularly the 'cry to sleep' philosophy.  For example, my little girl was very gassy for her first 12 weeks so she never napped or slept at night as well as the book claimed she should, which left me feeling that baby and I weren't doing something 'right' (I didn't realise she was suffering so much from gas until it disappeared like clockwork at 12 weeks). She would wake up habitually 30 minutes into her naps and could not get back to sleep - crying it out was never going to help her get over what must have been very real gas pains.<br />Overall, I would recommend Babywise as a useful read.  For all those opponents of the book out there, I would only suggest that you keep an open mind... if you try it, you may just see that it isn't really so evil after all!	2000-12-13	4

Having a child cry as a means to get anything (the demand fed way) seems more traumatic to the child in the long run.	2000-12-11	4

If you are a cold-hearted human being, yes you will find it helpful, but then, if you're that cold-hearted you probably shouldn't be having kids at all.  Gary Ezzo doesn't even have children of his own, has no medical or any other type of training in pediatrics or psycology.  He is a quack.  I also learned that following the advice in this book has caused death and failure to thrive in many infants.  This book has been denounced by the American Accademy of Pediatrics.	2000-12-10	4

I was not going to read it because I thought that demand feeding was the way to go.  What a mistake I would have made If I had followed my initial plan.  I went through over twenty-four hours of labor only to have a c-section in the end.  Believe me when I say I was worn out!  I decided to try the babywise method and although it was a little bit tough to get my son established in his new routine it was well worth our effort.  My son began to sleep through the night at ten weeks old.  <br />I have girlfriends with 3 year olds that still have not had more that three hours of sleep.  These are the same girls that swear that babywise is &quot;crap&quot;.  One of my friends had to go on anti-depressants because she can't get enough sleep and she is at her wits end.  My new baby is not quite three months old and is also beginning to sleep through the night.  I put him down at 7:30 pm and he wakes up anywhere between 5 and 7am.  He is content and happy.  He hardly ever cries and when he does cry I almost always know within seconds what his reason is.  I have seen un-babywise babies that cry and whine almost non-stop.  Their mothers almost always medicate them with tylenol or motrin and chalk up their fussiness to teething or a cold.  I wonder why they don't see that their children are just completely exhausted?  How many of us could take a series of thirty minute to an hour naps all day and night and function without being cranky and crying?  As adults we depend on many schedules and routines to make our lives workable.  We even schedule our own meals and sleep.  What makes us think that it is inhumane to give our children this same stablility.  Every word of the testimonials in the front of that book have come true for both of my babywise babies.	2000-12-04	4

This one, however, went straight into the trash to prevent another unsuspecting parent from picking it up.  If you must adhere to the &quot;cry-it-out&quot; philosophy, there ARE much kindler, gentler method books out there.  Ezzo wants you to feed your baby according to a rigid schedule.  He wants you to put your baby in its crib and walk away according to a rigid schedule.  He even wants your baby's waketime to work according to a rigid schedule.  This book was originally written, filled with religious doctrine.  It was REreleased in 1995 with the religion removed to appeal more to the mainstream public.  Originally, Ezzo's book said your baby should cry it out in its crib because of what might have happened if God had not ignored Jesus' cries on the cross.  New parents do not need the added stress of trying to parent their child according to someone else's idea of what a schedule should be.  If you're determined to buy this book, at least make an informed decision.  Rather than refer you to specific sites, simply go to your favorite search engine and type in the name of the book, or the name of the author.  You'll find plenty of information.  In the meantime, if you're looking for thoughtfully written baby books, supported by research and happy parents, check out William Sears.	2000-12-01	4

If you love your child, don't treat him or her like this.  I have a 14 month old baby and he does wake up occasionally in the night.  Not a problem.  I cuddle him or nurse him until he goes back to sleep.  I knew coming in that parenting takes some work and maybe a little sacrifice.  I comfort my child when he cries - I hold him when possible, or talk gently to him.  I have never isolated him.   I wouldn't dream of letting him cry alone for 5 minutes, let alone an hour.  Sure, a baby will go to sleep if you let him cry long enough.  He will learn that no one cares that he is lonely.  Learned hopelessness, one author has called it.  My child is not demanding.  I have always let him know I - or someone - would be there for him, and now he is trusting, secure, and affectionate.  He gets a little clingy when tired but otherwise is very independent and happy.  My husband and I love our baby and we want that to be the number one thing he knows in life.  Parenting isn't easy and it takes work and sometimes a little self-sacrifice, but we knew that going in.  Please don't buy this book, and if you already did, get rid of it!  Buy something by Dr. William Sears instead.  He writes about treating your child lovingly.	2000-12-01	4

After all, when you look at the variety of products recommended and produced by the Dr. Sears crowd, you can see they have a vested interest in getting you to follow their philosopy.  All this book has in mind is giving you the knowledge and advice you need to raise a happy, well-adjusted child.  Everyone I know who has actually put the tenets of this book to use has sung its praises--there are no exceptions to this rule.  I have to believe that the people who say bad things about it have not tried it.  Yes, it is the hardest thing you can do to put a baby down when it's naptime and let them cry for 15 minutes, but believe me, you only have to do that a few times for them to learn a very important skill--falling asleep on their own.  If they don't settle down in that period of time, you also have the confidence of knowing that something else is bothering them, like a burp, or being too cold, etc.  In the long run, this confidence in being able to understand your baby's needs is absolutely essential.  People continually marvel at my 3-month-old, who not only has been sleeping through the night since she was 7 weeks old, but who is predictably stable and never fussy.  We can take her to get-togethers with our friends and even to church, and she hardly makes a peep.  Both she and her cousin (also a babywise baby) are about the happiest babies on the planet.  They smile and giggle all the time and don't fuss when it's naptime or bedtime--and let me tell you--that makes for the happiest mom and dad on the planet!!!	2000-11-30	4

The only thing I didn't like was the pious attitude that if you don't raise your child like this, he will turn out to be a short-attention-span brat.

Their small bodies need frequent nourishment.  Since breast milk is digested much more quickly than formula, breastfed babies NEED to be fed every 2-3 hours.  Formula babies can go a little longer between feedings, but not much.  I read this book when I was pregnant and thought it sounded reasonable, but when baby was born, I had much better results when I followed my instincts -- nursing baby when she's hungry, holding her when she cries.  It is cruel to let a baby cry.  They do not have the mental capacities to &quot;manipulate&quot; parents, as the Ezzos purport!  There is ABSOLUTELY NO scientific research that newborns &quot;learn&quot; from crying.  NONSENSE! There is a reason a crying baby is upsetting to adults -- it's nature's way of ensuring the child gets the attention it NEEDS to thrive and grow!  The biggest problem with this book, however, is that the authors make numerous, medical-sounding claims that ARE NOT based on any research!  They sound authoritative, but their claims are pure rubbish!  Furthermore, Mr. Ezzo is a fraud!  He has no medical or psychological training.  He is allegedly a minister, although his educational credentials are also questionable.  This book contains no bibliography, which conveniently prevents the reader from doing any follow up research.  Of course, that is because there IS NO RESEARCH for a reader to pursue.  I could go on all day, but I hope I've made my point.  This book is trash.	2000-11-25	4

I exclusively breastfed and found that what this book says is true: feed the baby on a schedule and breastffeding will be easier and the baby will sleep through the night.  It's not just that it makes your (and the baby's life) simpler, the schedule helps to provide the baby with the stability kids yearn for and the milk he needs.  <br />In our case, if the baby was obviously hungry in 2 1/2 hours instead of 3, I fed him (as the book directs).  If he wasn't hungry until 3 1/2 hours, I waited.  Both he and I were happier and my milk production has stayed high (he's 8 months now and we're still on the schedule, still exclusively breastfeeding -- and he has slept through the night since he was 3 months old!).<br />Finally, this book has ensured that -- even though I'm back at work -- I have been able to continue to produce enough milk for my son.  I know when he eats at the day care because he's on a schedule.  I pump at work when he is scheduled to eat.  That way we both stay on the same schedule and I'm ready to feed him when I get off work.  The day care was skeptical at first, but once they saw how happy and comfortable he was eating on the schedule I had already established, they were more than happy to continue him on his schedule.<br />I recommend this book to any woman who is breastfeeding and wants to 1) sleep through the night and 2) maintain her milk production (even when she returns to work).	2000-11-07	4

Everyone we know who has applied the principals in this book recommended it to us wholeheartedly.  The authors may seem harsh sometimes - especially to a new and unsure mom as I was - but one of the main messages is FLEXIBILITY.  The authors never say to leave a hungry baby hungry - just that a crying baby is not always a hungry baby... babies have other needs besides hunger.  Your new baby will not starve on a 2 1/2 - 3 hour schedule (which by the way is a much more frequent feeding schedule than most grandmas went by).  Our baby was small at birth and we woke her up every 2 1/2 to 3 hours to feed her for the first month.  At 5 1/2 weeks she was sleeping 7-8hours at night and at 2 months she was in the 90th percentile for weight and height.  She is thriving, happy, and now, at 4 months, goes down at night and for naps without any fussing.	2000-11-07	4

I know so many who tried to follow the demand-fed method, carried their babies around for hours in a Bjorn, and spent a couple years trying to get their kids to sleep.  You can raise a healthy, wonderful child using any of the recommended methods.  However, if you follow Babywise you will also get a happy, rested, set of parents.

I bought this book when my son was three months old because he was having some sleep problems, and we needed to end our family bed situation.  I was appalled at the feeding schdule they advocated for breastfed babies.  It goes against what both my pediatrician and lactation consultant told me.  Feed your baby whenever he's hungry, and you'll know that he's doing well by the number of wet and dirty diapers he's having, and by weighing him periodically to make sure he's gaining roughly half a pound a week in the first three months.  Not feeding a child who's obviously hungry, just because he ate 2 hours ago, and not the book's recommended 3-4 is silly.

How can your baby become &quot;failure to thrive&quot; when you are following the action plan in this book? You are feeding every 2 1/2 to 3 hours, cuddling and talking to your baby while feeding her, spending at least one hour after daytime feedings singing to your baby, playing with her, and teaching her how much you love her. That equals at least 6 hours a day of one-on-one attention, and at least 8 feedings in a 24 hour period. If you only read the part that said it is okay for your child to cry sometimes and let that be the only lesson you learned from this book, you are just an idiot or a very poor parent! This book stresses the importance of flexibility to the schedule and common sense parenting. As with every parenting book, you should use good judgement and decide what works best for your child and you.    We read this book when our baby was 8 weeks old. The difference that it made in our lives was incredible. We had been letting our baby fall asleep during feedings or immediately thereafter. Once we started making sure he stayed awake for about an hour after daytime feedings, he napped better and longer and wasn't fussy anymore.  Before that, we were exhausted all the time and constantly passing a fussy baby back and forth. He was just not getting the right amount of quality sleep. As for the &quot;let your baby cry&quot; statements; read the book! You should be using a clock and watching how long your child is crying. We did not want to let our baby cry. We only let him cry one night for ten minutes. Then we went in and gave him his pacifier, spoke to him softly, and stroked his forehead. He went to sleep. From that night on he slept longer and longer. Within five days he was sleeping seven hours at a stretch. His disposition changed dramatically. He woke up happy and playful, not screaming or cranky like before. Now at four and a half months of age, he sleeps twelve hours a night and is a delightfulbaby. We are always hearing, &quot;What a happy boy!&quot; from everyone who sees him. We know that it is because we are Babywise parents. Read the book for yourself.	2000-10-14	4

We found the principles to be useful when used in a consistent but flexible way. We have highly recommended it to other parents we know. <br />Our child has thrived with this method. We didn't use it right away but after trying it noticed a big and very positive difference. I don't think the method is intended only to make life more convenient for the parent (although it does make life easier) without regard for the child.  I think that it helps parents to focus on identifying the child's needs, teaches them how to set up a schedule (children thrive on a schedule) to meet the childs needs and then also how to be flexible with it. <br />As some people might beleive, it's not about leaving your child to cry alone in his/her crib and ignoring him or her.  It's about understanding why the baby is crying and then responding to the cry in an appropriate manner (and sometimes the best response is to do nothing). For example, if s/he is tired and crying because s/he is tired then let him/her go to sleep.  It's also about forming good sleeping patterns which ultimately helps a child's development. And there's lots more in the book.<br />I found the book to have a common sense approach with lots of good advice for parents. We are very happy that we read it.	2000-09-28	4

The problem with this book is that it needs a thorough editing to clarify and correct the contradictions throughout the book. The basic premise is very simple, but they need to clean up the charts, make the numbers consistent throughout. Someone else (a GOOD writer) ought to write a book on Parent Directed Feeding, make it smaller, simpler, more charts and schedules, and they would have a winner on their hands. But until that day, Babywise is the best choice out there. So, if you want to raise a whiny, demanding, self-centered kid, follow the 'popular' Demand Feeding approach espoused by many of the liberal reviewers of this book. If you want a happy, healthy kid, use the Parent Directed Feeding method promoted in Babywise.	2000-09-22	4

Prolactin, essential to maintaining milk supply, is generated in  greater quantities during night nursings. Why would nature make this so?  Lactoferrin, a compound found in breastmilk but NOT in formula, kills the  strepmutans that cause tooth decay, so rather than being detrimental, night  brestfeeding PREVENTS tooth decay. But never mind Nature's design: do the  CONVENIENT thing so you can watch your favorite TV programs ON SCHEDULE.	2000-09-19	4

Instead of following my motherly instincts and caring for my  crying, hungry baby, I enforced rigid schedules, allowed my baby to cry,  and spent a miserable 2.5 weeks post=partum wondering why I was so stressed  when this book had been so highly recommended. And here I was, following it  to a &quot;T&quot;.<br />At my first checkup, the doctor was appalled to see  my lethargic son (who had not gained any weight since I left the hospital)  and told me to head straight for the ER. My boy was suffering from  dehydration and was diagnosed failure to thrive. I was thankfully given a  lot of wonderful and correct information by caring hospital staff and  social workers and the best thing i ever did was THROW THIS BOOK AWAY. It  is dangerous. I should have known, all my instincts told me to hold and  feed my baby when he cried, I shouldn't have done otherwise. Thank God my  baby is happy, healthy today and he is now breastfed on demand and cuddled  all he wants and needs to be! It's not about &quot;control&quot; it's about  being loving and kind to your trusting, helpless baby.	2000-09-16	4

I  also had a copy of &quot;The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding&quot;.  I far  prefer Babywise and the methods it teaches.  My 5 month old is the  happiest, most content baby I've ever known, and is the delight of nursery  workers and friends who watch her. As a new mother, I was always concerned  &quot;what does this cry mean? what is she trying to tell me?&quot;   Babywise helped me differentiate between my baby's cries, and respond  appropriately, sometimes with food, other times with a quick hug or gentle  rocking, sometimes just putting her down for a nap; it never says to ignore  a baby's crying (beyond 5-10 minutes)  My daughter has been sleeping  through the night since she was 8 weeks old (9-10 hours at a time), and not  through &quot;forced&quot; methods such as over-feeding before bedtime.  Anyone who criticizes this book for being too rigid obviously did not read  very carefully.  Many times, Ezzo clearly states that the methods are a  guide only, and parents need to be flexible and responsive to their  particular child's needs. The only problem I had with the book was the  emphasis on the first 3 months, and referring me to BabywiseII for more  information.  I would like to see a more comprehensive discussion contained  in a single volume. This book is a must-have for any parent who still wants  a life, and doesn't want to be tied to the house because of their baby's  completely unpredictable wants.	2000-09-15	4

At that point I was pretty much nursing round the  clock, sleeping on the couch with Owen lying on me so we could get a little  rest and so could my husband. During the day I was holding him or he was in  the Snugli thing if he wasn't nursing or using me as a pacifer. **2 WEEKS  LATER** after reading the book, we are on a routine, he takes naps IN HIS  CRIB during the day with just a little crying when I first lay him down  (not every time) and he is sleeping 7-8 hrs most nights, and best of all we  BOTH know what to expect next (when we eat,play,sleep) I can now plan  household stuff, trips to the park, grocery shopping, etc. In response to  the negative reviews...USE YOUR COMMON SENSE....the book is only to be used  as a guide and you and your baby have to be ready (maybe a few weeks old,  not just home from the hospital), that way you know your baby well enough  to tell if he's is gaining weight, happy and a little about how and why he  crys. This book has worked out great for our family, I can't imagine what  things would be like without it. I wish my cousin had told me about it when  I was pregnant.	2000-09-14	4

I am horrified at all the negative comments that people have written about  this book!  I first heard about this book when a friend of mine from our  bowling league bought it when she had her first baby.  This child was an  absolute delight to be around.  He was sleeping through the night around  six weeks (&quot;sleeping through the night&quot; to mean around six-seven  hours) and just happy as could be.  So I bought it for my first baby...and  she was sleeping through the night at six-seven weeks, up to 9-10 hours  around eight weeks...and no, I don't have a &quot;sleeper&quot; for a  child.  And I'm not &quot;just lucky.&quot;  I am a practical, LOVING  mother who bought into the principles taught by this book.  Namely that  this child is a welcome addition to the family, but that we are NOT going  to be child centered.  You would not believe the compliments we receive  from just about everyone who comes in contact with our daughter.  She is a  delightful child who is a pleasure to be around.  And no, it's not all  &quot;just her disposition.&quot;  She was trained to behave the way we  want her to behave...she was trained correctly the first time so that we  don't have to re-train a bad habit (and no, I don't think of my child as a  dog when I use the word &quot;train.&quot;)  The problem with so many  children today is that they were raised in a me-me-me environment and have  always gotten their way.  To be a good parent, you have to say  &quot;no&quot; sometimes and you HAVE to set boundaries.  Otherwise you  will have a horror for a child whom no one will want to be around.  Do you  know that my daughter has NEVER thrown a tantrum?  I attribute just about  everything that has to do with how my child has been raised to this man and  his wonderful books.  I have bought all three and if he keeps 'em coming,  I'll get them through adulthood.	2000-09-12	4

When  my baby was 2 weeks old, I read the book in one sitting. I have a  &quot;high need&quot; baby, who cried almost all the time for the first 6  weeks. He used to fall asleep for about two minutes after nursing, then  cried until the next feeding, barely getting any sleep. After reading the  book, I tried to keep him awake right after feeding and then let him have a  nap. This did actually make things a bit better, but nothing like what my  friends described. They have an 'easy' baby though, and I wonder if  anything would have worked for them. It would have been very helpful if he  discussed the difficult and colicky baby, and perhaps what to do if you  have a baby who's constant crying makes it nearly impossible to determine  when he's truly hungry, and a baby who never falls into any kind of  schedule on his own. He also shuns co-sleeping. I never thought I would  sleep with my baby, but I brought him to bed with me at two weeks, planning  to transfer him to the cradle once asleep, but when we both woke up, it was  time for a feeding. He finally slept well-- sleeping 5 hours the first  stretch. He slept with me until 8 weeks, when we finally transferred him to  his crib. We missed him the first few nights! I think that Ezzo's theory  has merit, but the bottom line is you have to do what works for the family  and the baby.	2000-09-01	4

I did not use it as a Bible.  I took what made sense to me  (feedtime, waketime, sleeptime) out of it and ignored those items that I  did not agree with (letting your baby cry himself to sleep).  As a working  mother who wanted to breastfeed her child, I was discouraged by everything  I read about feeding your baby whenever he wanted to eat.  I heard too many  stories about feeding times being unpreditable and varied.  This was the  first book that talked about putting a breastfed baby on a schedule (which  is critical while I work). Although I did not follow Mr. Ezzo's timelines,  I worked with my baby to establish a routine.  I let my son guide me.  Now  at 11 weeks, my son is sleeping through the night, is on a predictable  feeding schedule, and I am able to continue breastfeeding.  On top of that,  he is very healthy and happy (our pediatrician just commented on how big  and healthy he was).  Like any childrearing book, you need to use common  sense and pick and choose what works for you.  But, if you have such little  faith in your abilities to parent and follow this book as if it were the  Bible on childrearing then of course you will have problems.	2000-08-31	4

They work not only to get your child to  sleep long, peaceful hours (for both of you), but also to build a happy,  confident child.  My daughter is 10 months old and slept through the night  at 8 weeks.  I hear the phrases &quot;she is such a happy baby&quot; and   &quot;you are so lucky&quot; on a daily basis.  That's the truth.  <br />I've  read some of the criticisms listed in the reviews on these pages and would  simply recommend if your pregnant, buy the book and read it.  Then decide  what you want to try.   Two married friends (both family physicians)  recommended the book to us.  We read it, tried it and couldn't be happier.   So many experts think they have the right answer about the key to an  emotionally intact child.  Give me a break.  We all know that love,  compassion and bonding are critical for sound emotional development.  Does  Babywise negate any of those principles?  NO. In fact it encourages them in  a structured format.  <br />Read the book and decide for yourself.  It works.	2000-08-20	4

Common sense will dictate how you react or manage your specific situation based on your child's individual  health and circumstances. However this book provided my wife and I with  excellent guidelines for raising our child. My daughter is now 15months,  she is loved very much and is probably repremanded less now because we set  some gorund rules when she was younger. My daughter goes to bed at 7:30pm  and wakes up around 6:30-7:00am. She is emotionally secure, happy and  loved. My wife and I have time to spend with each other in the evening and  this is nourishing for our relationship. Alot of it as a result to advise  from this book. We are now expecting a second child and we will use this  information again. I strongly recomend you read it and decide for your  self.

Berry Brazelton M.D. (who also writes helpful books for parents), this approach shows incredible lack of respect for your child.  Listen to what your own instincts are telling you - your child is  not born into this world to make your life miserable or to manipulate you.   If your child is crying - it wants something from you - most likely comfort  or affection.  There are ways of getting a good nights sleep that do not  require you to let your child cry until they are inconsolable, and ways of  fostering good manners and behaviour that do not require you to emotionally  abandon your child. Your child is only this age once - and the sleepless  nights will be soon enough over when your child is ready.  You will miss  these days when your child is a teenager, and wonder how you could have  thought them a problem.  I sympathise with parents who are facing lack of  sleep or other problems, but remember: you only get one chance to do this  right -- and teaching your child that you won't be there when it needs you  is NOT the way to do it. Buy Dr. William Sears book instead.	2000-07-27	4

She is now 6 1/2 months old, breastfed, and has slept through the night  since 4 weeks. Everyone who meets her comments that &quot;she is so  happy!&quot;  And so are her parents.  We're not experiencing the sleep  deprivation that it seems so many new parents do.  And by the way, I didn't  find anything cruel or harmful in this book.

My girl cried 20 min the first night, 5 min the second night and 1 hour the 3rd night,  afterwhich I run, full of tears and broken heart, to cuddle and comfort  her.  I have noticed a change in her in the morning, she was extremely sad,  as normally she is a very happy baby. I felt like I let her down. I swore I  will NEVER let her cry to sleep again. I now believe all babies are  different, some will sleep through the night, some won't and some will  sleep sometimes. The fact is that each baby has different needs and there  is no way on earth you will teach your baby to fall asleep on her own if  she just does not. She might need you, and if you are not there you will  loose her trust and therefore her happiness.<br />I cannot believe that this  book was published in the United States and is available on bookstore  shelves labeled for &quot;baby care&quot;, where an advice seeking mother  hopes to find doctors help in caring for her newborn.  I think there is  something wrong with American system to allow this to happen. This book  should be labeled as &quot;fiction&quot;.

After reading them I came to the conclusion I would have to read the book just to see what all the  controversy is about.  Since reading it I have realized that the people  that are against it didn't want to like the book and the methods in the  first place. They consistantly put down the author as being a tyrant and  bordering on be an abuser of babies. They took just about everything he  said and twisted it into what they wanted to hear to justify their  cosleeping, constantly holding and making the baby the center of their  family rather than an equal part. All I can say is the author constantly  says to monitor your baby, your milk supply to make sure he is getting  enough to eat and know your baby's crys. He never said let your baby cry  and cry and cry. He said using his methods you will be able to tell what  kind of a cry it is and when to respond as necessary. He also said it is  fine to go in and comfort your baby. He also stated no one should use the  clock as a soul source of when to feed your baby. He made suggestions for  different situations. He even said, God forbid, that you are the parent and  the decision is yours on how you want to handle situations that arise.<br />So  I will say I read the book with an open mind and I found it very  compassionate towards infants, towards families and especially towards the  importance of the two parents' relationship.<br />And on the comment many  people made about, &quot;if an ederly person were treated this  way....&quot; to that I say read the book again because I didn't hear any  abuse going on. If a ederly person were truly known and monitored, the way  Ezzo suggests monitoring infants, they'd probably have better care than the  nursing homes are currently providing.<br />So to those of you thinking about  using this method take in all the reviews you'd like but read the book and  use your own common sense.<br />  <br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------	2000-07-26	4

Let me first qualify my remarks by saying that I've been working with various types of dysfunctional families on a professional level for over 29 years now, including work in the fields of Child Abuse Prevention and Drug  Abuse Prevention. I'm also the father of two adult children.<br />This Ezzo  approach to the treatment of children makes me afraid for the children of  parents who might adopt the attitudes toward children held by this Ezzo  fellow.<br />I want to say that I've studied child-rearing approaches on both  an historical and anthropological basis, and have *never* encountered an  approach toward the treatment of children that poses a greater degree of  threat to the well-being of children than is being proposed by Mr. Ezzo,  whose only generally recognized accredited academic credentials consist of  some non-degreed course-work at a community college. Apparently, his appeal  to young christian parents stems largely from his claim that `his way' is  `God's way'......as he is otherwise wholly unqualified to present himself  as an `authority' in the area of child-rearing.<br />While there have been  approaches practiced in the past which were designed to break the spirit  and `will' of children, I have never seen one that attempted to accomplish  this task (beginning in infancy) with such *specificity*. I can only assume  that this treatment of children is designed to create lost souls who will  be primed for salvation. I'm sorry if this offends anyone, but I simply  cannot fathom another reasonable explanation for this treatment of our  young, short of accusing this man displaying sadistic tendencies.<br />Please  folks. Children are suffering unnecessarily at the hands of this harsh  cruelty, and we don't yet know what the long-term impact this approach  toward child-rearing will have on society as a whole. Will adherents of  this ultra-authoritarian approach raise children who will isolate  themselves in a tight-knit cult, or will we be seeing broken minds, broken  spirits, and broken hearts spilling out into the general population? How  many Failure To Thrive cases will it take to eradicate this movement? Will  Ezzo deem it more pragmatic to hide these kids from the medical and health  care professions in an effort to further his cause (along with his  profits)?<br />In the spirit of the teachings of Jesus Christ, please believe  that you can be a good Christian without ignoring the needs of your babies,  or beating your children into fearful submission.	2000-07-21	4

My first child is now four months old and has been sleeping through the night since she was seven weeks.  I used this book to learn about how to feed her to get her to sleep through the night when she was first born and  now I am using it to learn how to introduce solid foods.  It is easy to  read and understand.  In fact, I have certain pages marked to refer back to  from time to time.   My baby is happy, well rested, and growing like a  weed.  This strategy is wonderful for parents who would like to be well  rested and be able to appreciate their happy, growing baby during the day!	2000-07-18	4

I don't doubt their claim--it is characteristic of all babies, whether they  follow the Ezzo method or not. <br />This book is based on the premise that by  following their recommendations your baby will sleep through the night.   The problem is that you cannot prove the cause and effect relationship that  they claim.  <br />Every baby starts out sleeping for fairly short periods  before waking for a feed.  As the baby matures, it sleeps for longer  periods between feeds.  I have two children whom I raised in exactly the  same way.  My first was able to sleep for 8 hours before waking for a feed  starting around 6 weeks of age; my second took nearly 6 months to get to  that point.  What can explain the difference in their behavior?  I believe  it is simply that the first baby's internal clock was quicker to adjust to  nighttime sleep than the second baby's.<br />If you try and influence your  baby's sleeping pattern, as I did with my second (because I was sick of  getting up at night!) you will end up with a very cranky baby who needs a  lot of extra holding and comforting.  This adds an extra burden to an  already tired mother.  A baby that is well rested is happy to play with his  toys by himself for 15 or 20 minutes stretches, enough to give mother a  break now and again.  And a baby is only well rested when he is allowed to  sleep when he feels the need to do so.<br />I tried to follow the Ezzo routine  and was left utterly frustrated and despondent.  Having said that, though,  it is only fair to point out that one of the traits of good mothers is  their ability to be very well organized.  I agree in adhering to a  schedule, but not as a means of controlling a baby's behavior; rather, to  make mother's life a little bit easier.	2000-07-15	4

With my first child I nursed on demand, and didn't get more than 2 hours straigt sleep for 6 months.  (I finally resorted to breaking that habit, and my heart by  letting my baby cry himself back to sleep for about 4 nights in a row.)  He  was thriving, in the 95th percentile for weight.  With my second son I  followed the Baby Wise guidelines (I came from a neighborhood of new moms  who swore by it) and had a baby who slept through the night at 7 weeks. I  never had to listen to him cry himself to sleep, it just happened. He was  also much more content during daytime hours.  He, too, was thriving,  gaining a full pound his first week and four during the first month and  always in the 90th percentile range.  I'll be using the Baby Wise  guidelines with our third.  I am surprised that some readers think the  authors are telling you to ignore your child.  I never got that from  reading this book.  I understood them to say babies cry for different  reasons, don't automatically assume it's hunger, and don't respond with a  bottle or breast if hunger isn't what's bothering them.  They also write of  babies need to play and for companionship, and encourage you and other  family members to fulfill these needs.  If you want a book that helps you  sleep through the night (which I believe is beneficial for baby and mom) by  establishing a rather flexible routine, then Baby Wise is for you.  If,  however, you'd prefer to let your baby make all the demands, and are okay  with an erratic schedule (and all the moodiness for baby, mom and dad)  which can occur, then maybe this book is not for you.	2000-07-12	4

Over the last twenty-odd years, an undercurrent of parenting ideas and practices has begun to make its presence felt in the West. I refer to, among others,  Continuum Concept, Taking Children Seriously, and much of what comes under  the umbrella of Attachment Parenting. The practices have in common the  notion that young children, and above all babies, know, better that any  parenting manual, precisely what it is that they need in order to develop  in the optimum fashion. The idea is that by listening (literally or  figuratively) to our children, and also to our instincts, while believing,  as a guiding principle, that Nature really does know best, we can allow our  children to achieve close to their potential fill of happiness and  well-adjustedness. Then...along comes a book like this one to return us to  the Dark Ages, so to speak.  Gary Ezzo's parenting techniques are not new;  in fact, they are depressingly familiar. It is a soulless, simplistic,  repressive approach to the awesome task of caring for babies and young  children which plays/preys on the understandable desire of most new parents  to reintroduce a little order (and sleep) into their lives.  As for the  ideas themselves, by and large they are opinions and assertions, backed up  by little in the way of evidence based on either research or  well-documented observation. Full of half-truths and disingenuousness.   Sad...above all for the defenceless victims of  &quot;Ezzoism&quot;.	2000-07-05	4

I read the first babywise book (I still refer to it), and no where in the literature  is there any hint of abuse. I think I have finally found out where the  selfish, annoying people are made. They must reside in the homes of those  parents who let the kids run the show. My husband and I are constantly  being told what a happy, giggly baby we have. I have to believe that some  of that disposition comes from the routine that he has been placed on. He  slept through the night at 9 weeks. He is 5 months old now, but to the  naysayers dismay, he is a strapping 20 lbs. and 28 inches! Please do not  let negative reviews of this book discourage you from at least reading what  the concepts involve.

The basic premise: You, as a parent, know how to meet your baby's needs best; you dictate the schedules.  Once you realize this principle,  taking care of your new creation becomes easy.<br />We read the book before  our baby was born so were prepared for the challange ahead.  We did not  start on the process discussed in the book until just after 6 weeks, as the  book recomends. Once started, by the 8th week our beautiful boy was  skipping the 3am feeding, and after the 10th he was skipping the 12am  feeding thus sleeping from 9pm to 6 am.  After 12 weeks he was sleeping  from 8pm to 7:30am.<br />It was difficult to let him cry for 15-30 min. at a  time.  But this only lasted for one to two nights at most with our boy.   After that he slept fine.   There was NO danger at all to him or his  health, as some reviewers have stated.  He was born 9lbs 15oz, we have now  followed this plan for 1 year and he has been in the 95-105% in weight and  size, since birth.  <br />Like ALL parenting books on the market I have read,  this one is also very opinionated (if you do not do this then your child  will somehow not function in society).  As a discerning parent you have to  take all advise with a grain of salt and apply what works and does not  work, including mine.  As a foundation, this plan works, our sanity and  nights of peace are proof.	2000-06-30	4

After reading this book, I am a little concerned about its message. I am worried that parents might blindly accept its &quot;lessons&quot; and neglect the needs of their children. It is not easy with such young babies  to interperet their cries to see if they are hungry, cold, in pain, tired,  wet or dirty. Hunger is not the only reason they cry.<br />I am concerned that  people are nowadays not willing to be disrupted by their children. Have we  forgotten that young babies ARE an interruprion to our ADULT routine? They  need feeding (and sometimes at night), especially at the age this book is  focusing on. They also need to know their parent is there for them at such  a young age. They have no understanding of an adult who wants a full nights  sleep, they have such primal needs, and ones that aren't hard to deal with  either.<br />I think this sort of parenting approach is not really appropriate  for newborn babies. I realise some people disagree, but think readers  should consider WHY they are trying to make their baby sleep through. Is it  for the baby, or perhaps a slighly more selfish reason.	2000-06-28	4

My first child is not due for another several months, so I have no working knowledge of the method. Like all the reading I have done so far, I am taking the advice with a grain of  salt. However, I am very surprised to read several reviews attacking the  book and the author for things I feel the book does not advocate in the  first place. Not once did I ever get the impression that the idea is to  ignore your child! The idea is to EVALUATE the nature of the distress  before automatically offering the breast or the bottle. Appropriate  response rather than automatic response is the idea. As for Failure to  Thrive, several, several times the author recommends checking your baby's  growth and development against the norm and proceeding accordingly. For a  parent to do otherwise with any method would be ignorant and neglectful.  <br />I had to LAUGH when I read the review claiming that the author says that  babies are evil and manipulative! What? Where? The same reviewer sited  studies in which infant monkees were left untouched in cages and hence  died. While it is very true that neglect causes failure to thrive and  serious developmental problems, I fail to see this fact's relevence to the  book in question. The book frequently refers to parental cuddle time and  even -gasp- recommends comforting your child when he cries. I'm not sure  everyone is reading the same book! Or reading at all.<br />Lastly, I never had  one impression or another about the author's religion. Living in the  belt-buckle of the Bible Belt, I am warry of the Christian Right and other  extreme religious groups. Not once did I feel uncomfortable or preached to.  How could I, there was no sermon! Though I defend the book on these points,  I have yet to be in a postition to review the method. I encourage all new  parents like myself to educate themselves on a variety of parenting skills  and to use good judgement in selecting the ones that seem right for yourvery individual and unique child.<br />I knew nothing of this method or the  author before someone gave me Baby Wise, so I feel I can be fairly  objective in my statements here.

This book emphasizes considering  the context of each situation and flexibility, versus following strict  rules.  The principles of the series of books are guidelines.  My daycare  provider, of 25 years experience, says my daugher is a pleasure to watch,  and is a exceptionally happy.  These books emphasise training your child's  heart morally for future intrinsic motivation versus intrinsic motivation.  They advocate strong marraiges, playtime with and affection to your child,  repecting others (manners) and others' things.  Something to consider in  this time!  This book is just the beginning principles that are  age-appropriate. After reading this first book, my mothering became much  more enjoyable.  It offers flexibility to our lives.  It has decreased our  stress immeasurably (mine, husband's and baby's) because I rarely have to  guess at what she needs when she cries.  She now wakes on her own in time  for feedings without crying, and I lay her down to sleep, rarely with a  fuss.  When it is her bedtime, she is like an alarm clock and gets a little  fussy a few minutes before I lay her down...and she sleeps for 8-9 hrs a  night!

For example,  my daughter generally ate every three hours, but I had to adjust her  schedule when she was going through growth spurts.  At one point, she was  eating every 1.5 hours because she was growing so much!<br />I have heard so  many stories of people following this method to the letter of the law and  complaining that their kids are hungry.

Both had babies who fell below the growth chart  and had delays in their gross motor development (i.e. sitting and walking  later than others their same age).  <br />As a full-time mom and former  pediatric therapist I can't believe that ignoring a baby's cues now will  improve your relationship with the child later.   With so many good books  out there on infant care, why waste your time and money on something so  potentially harmful?	2000-05-31	4

It gave us a plan to go by when bringing home a newborn.  Our baby slept through the night at 12 weeks, this of course helped our marriage and my life as a new mom.  Many of our  friends recommended Baby Wise and we all have healthy, happy and  well-rested babies who sleep through the night!  I have no idea what book  the negative reviewers are talking about.  As a college educated teacher, I  took this worthy information and just like with any advice/book, I adapted  the parts that worked for my family and I.  Our daughter has had wonderful  check-ups and our &quot;schedule&quot; has been supported whole-heartedly  by our doctor.  My advice is: Don't knock it until you've tried it...it's  feeding about every 21/2 to 3 hours (the same advice I was given by the  nurses in the hospital).	2000-05-31	4

Like any book, you need to take away what is of value.  I believe in the eat, wake, sleep  cycle, but the 3-4 hour feeding cycles can be too short for breast fed  babies. Breast milk is digested more quickly than formula and babies have  very small stomaches which may not store enough nutrition to last for 3-4  hours. My baby ate every 2-2.5 hours and nursed for 1-1.5 hours at a time.   On this schedule, he slept through the night beginning at 5 weeks.  I had  initially tried to lengthen his feedings out to 3 hours as recommended by  Baby Wise, but soon realized that he was hungry before the 3 hour mark.   Following the 3-4 hour cycle recommendation can be dangerous to some  newborns.  If your baby fits the 3-4 hours cycle, great.  If not, follow  your parenting instincts and feed your baby if you think he's hungry.	2000-05-29	4

Within a month after I discontinued using the Babywise method, my baby slept 10 hours at night without waking, and was taking consistent  naps.  Contrary to what the book said, he organized his days and nights  when I just followed his lead.  <br />At night my baby goes to bed awake  without rocking, nursing or a pacifier and puts himself to sleep.   Sometimes he lies in  his crib for thirty minutes, smiles and coos at his  mobile and then does nothing more than whine for a few minutes before  drifting off.  This was all done without ignoring my baby and letting him  cry for extended periods of time.  All that was necessary initially was  putting him in his crib just before he closed his eyes, so that he put  himelf to sleep for the last few seconds.  This gradually has extended to  minutes.  I urge parents to just use their instincts.  Babies can sleep  through the night relatively early without employing the Babywise method.	2000-05-25	4

The Babywise plan was recommended to me by a number of people. The outcome was a desirable one, but it seemed to recommend that women do the exact  opposite of what lactation consultants advise. Could it work with  breastfeeding?<br />By some miracle, some women do succeed at breastfeeding  and scheduling their baby's feeds. But they are the lucky ones. I read a  study on how a woman's body makes milk, and I read that women produce more  milk during the in between periods than previously thought, but women  differ in how much milk they can store in their bodies by as much as 300%.  <br />Every woman can produce enough milk to nourish her baby, the study  concluded, but some women must nurse more often than others to produce the  same amount.<br />Another analysis of the Babywise method I read said that it  was most likely to work in babies who were at least 8 lbs. at birth.<br />I  also read somewhere that a newborn has a stomach the size of a walnut.  Also, breastmilk is digested more quickly by babies than formula is, so  these babies naturally need to nurse more often. One must also consider  that this child faces the task of tripling his body weight in the next  year.<br />It wasn't the idea that this was cruel to babies that most turned  me off of the Babywise plan (although I do think it is cruel to use a  baby's nourishment to try to &quot;teach&quot; it patience when the baby is  developmentally not ready to understand the concept). It was the scientific  facts that spoke loudly against the use of this plan for breastfed  babies.<br />If you want to use this plan and intend to (or are) formula feed  your babies, go for it, as long as the baby's health is not jeopardized.  But if you plan to nurse and want to succeed, don't do it. Or realize that  using this plan may possibly keep you from successfully nursing.<br />You've  got to decide what is more important to you, the best nourishment for yourchild or a peaceful night's sleep. My vote was the best nourishment of my  child, and I'll never regret it.	2000-05-19	4

The advice offered is not thebe all and end all in infant feeding, but it is basically sound.<br />Asnew parents, we were introduced to this book by our Pediatrician who was a devotee.  We had heard it had a Christian agenda, but we bought it in spite of that to make our own decision about the advice as to its practicality.  After reading it, it seemed sensible so we went with the plan starting with our son's very first feeding.<br />We continued with the plan and with ADAPTATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS it worked well.  Our son was above birthweight after 2 days.  He slept through the night in 7 weeks and maintained above the 50th percentile in weight throughout infancy.  He napped readily with little fuss in most cases.  He is two now and he is well behaved, sleeps like a log at night and naps without any problems.<br />That being said I want to go back to ADAPTATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS.  Any success plan requires situation specific adjustments.  You need to look at this book as a guideline, not a gospel.  In almost every horror story I've read about this plan I have found a statement like, &quot;I followed the plan to the letter.&quot; Therein lies the problem.  Anyone who sits there and listens to her baby cry for an hour because she is following some plan out of a book needs a mental exam.<br />My spouse and I have noticed among our friends that on-demand feeding tends to produce on-demand parents and unruly children.  I believe that babies (as well as children and adults) need structure, but it needs to be FLEXIBLE STRUCTURE.  It needs to be situation specific, child specific and even mood specific.  You need to set your boundaries with bungee cord, not with barbed wire.  Stay on the feeding schedule as much as possible, but for heaven's sake be alert to what your baby is telling you.  You may have to deviate for a few feedings or even days and then ease the baby back into the schedule.  Flex, then bounce back.<br />If you apply the advice in the book in this way and give your baby lots of love, hugs and affection, you will probably find that the plan has a lot of benefits.	2000-05-14	4

When my wife and I had our first child the nurses, doctors, and baby books all had different advice on how to take care of our newborn.  Baby Wise had been highly recommended to us.  I am so grateful to Ezzo for giving us a  guide to follow.  Those of you who don't think this book is great did not  read it all the way.  It is not something you strictly follow but a guide  to help you make decisions to soothe your baby and help them develop  healthy sleep patterns.  By the way, most people go 6 or 7 hours without  food -WHEN THEY SLEEP!  Our baby sleeps through the night and wakes up with  a smile on his face.  Those of you who want to spoil your children by  stuffing food down their mouths everytime they cry - get a life!  Baby Wise  does not tell you to let your child cry for any longer than 15 minutes.  It  also says if they do go comfort them. That maybe all they need is some time  in Mommy's arms. I love my baby and I am convinced that this guide has  helped me know what to expect and how to handle situations in a manner that  helps my baby learn disapline and be a happy healthy child.	2000-05-13	4

Every mom I personally know (6 of my  close friends and family)who has used the Babywise plan has been thrilled  with the results, and the dads are all for it too!  The book DOES allow  some flexibility, contrary to what some reviews suggest.  It's not a rigid  system of neglecting your child.

Two weeks after her baby was born, she &amp; her husband began applying the Ezzo principles because they were &quot;desperate for a good night's sleep.&quot; They effectively  taught their son that if he cried, they would not respond, so he stopped  crying for any reason. His weight started to plummet, since he never  &quot;asked&quot; for food, and he became quite lethargic. As an  inexperienced mother, this woman thought she had a &quot;good&quot; baby  because he was so cooperative -- using definitions from the Ezzo book.   Luckily, the pediatrician realized what was happening before the child had  to be hospitalized.  The child is now 5 and has various emotional and  developmental problems that the doctors say are a direct result of neglect  in his early months. These are not bad people -- they were just very  inexperienced parents who put all their trust in the Ezzo philosophy  instead of following their instincts.<br />I have since read the book, and I  think that its blanket statements are very easy for an inexperienced parent  to misunderstand. This is a dangerous book for new parents, and I would not  recommend it at all.	2000-05-09	4

I want to bust the myth that the Babywise &quot;method&quot; has ANYTHING to do with when babies begin to sleep through the night!   Babies' sleep patterns naturally being to regulate at around 8 weeks, as their stomachs  grow and they are able to eat more in a feeding, keeping their appetites  sated.  Babywise exploits this developmental fact and convinces people that  its &quot;methods&quot; are responsible for babies' sleep, when in reality  around 8 weeks is when babies have matured enough to begin sleeping for  periods longer than 2 hours at a stretch.<br />     My father is a  pediatrician and my brother is a family doctor, and they agree that the  Babywise method is wrong, and that being a responsive parent is right.  My  thriving &amp; happy  2 month old bears this out.  She began sleeping 7  hours a night at 7 weeks, and at 10 weeks now sleeps 8-10 hours a night.   She is a product of attachment parenting (no co-sleeping), Dr. Sears' The  Baby Book, and my instinctive RESPONSES to her cries.  To ignore an  infant's cries is cruel and inhuman, and to think that ignoring them will  help the baby to &quot;sleep&quot; is downright illogical.	2000-05-07	4

Parenting is a nighttime responsibility,  not an 8-5 job; the things Ezzo advocates are not in the best interest of  the child. I hope anyone reading Ezzo's advice weighs it against the  criteria of whether the advice is in the interest of the child.  Ezzo is  actually under investigation for causing failure to thrive and even death.  Babies need lots of hugs and touching; Ezzo advocates letting them lay in  the cribs and cry. A study on monkeys was done years ago, in which the baby  monkeys were not hugged or held. They all died. Failure to thrive is a  medical term and unfortunately it happens daily, especially in babies whose  parents follow Ezzo's teachings. This is not an opinion, it is a reference  to a news article highlighting medical concerns linking Ezzo to FTT.<br />The  American Academy of Pediatrics as well as the main pediatrician association  have issued statements warning parents not to take his advice. He tells  parents that babies are inherently evil and manipulative (from a religious  basis), that babies should sleep through the night by 8 weeks without  eating or soiling their diapers. And tells parents to ignore them if they  want to eat at night, or need a diaper changed at night at 8 weeks. Says  it's okay for a baby to cry until it vomits blood. <br />Babies are born  needing their parents for everything, especially love. How could one have a  baby and then treat him/her as Ezzo recommends? I can't wait for him to be  an old man, rotting in a nursing home with people treating him the way he  treats babies. <br />I actually actively campaign my local bookstores to  become aware of his dangers, and order documentation of criticism and  warnings, that I give them. There's a doctor in California who is so  concerned for the welfare of these babies, that he sends a free packet  and/or PDF file to anyone emailing him (aneybody@aol.com).	2000-05-05	4

I received this book for a baby shower and was at first thrilled by the prospect of getting our baby to sleep through the night. It made some  sense, and I thought I would apply the principles in a loose way --  discounting the theory that newborns need time alone, for example. In  short, the methods made me miserable, made my baby hungry (she took 3 weeks  to regain birth weight) and eventually led to the demise of my milk supply.  I also understand that the Ezzos include spanking from the age of as early  as 5 months as part of their theory. All in all, I think this method  teaches parents to distance themselves from their children and ignore their  own instincts. Try The Baby Book by William Sears instead.	2000-05-04	4

It was the best thing that ever happened to us!  Our child was sleeping through the night in 3 days, and adapted to  the switch easily.  The mere presence of a routine has kept behavioral  problems to a minimum. I realize children are all individuals, and maybe  we're just lucky, but others that interact with our son can not believe how  well behaved he is! My sister can't believe the difference either, and has  even gone to the extent of starting the Babywise/Childwise principles with  her toddler. I am a teacher myself, logic lends itself to Ezzo's prinicpals  on establishing security by establishing routine and still providing  flexibility. There's many criticisms to his teachings, but after much  research, I believe many parents haven't truly &quot;understood&quot; the  method, and have forgotten the ultimate truth, that we still need to  &quot;parent&quot; the child.  Ezzo's principals on marriage and strength  in old fashioned parenting are just what we need in todays declining moral  society!

They are almost identical.<br />My biggest concern with the system outlined here is the authors' lack of credentials.  Mr. Ezzo has a masters of arts, it's true, but that is because he has had  life experience credited to him. He has no associate's or bachelor's degree  from any university. His wife, Anne Marie, worked briefly as an RN close to  20 years ago.

They are, in fact, mostly the parenting philosophies if the author  and the science cited to support many of his claims has been called into  question.  Do your baby a favor and get the facts behind this book before  you give in to it's promise.	2000-04-26	4

I started Baby Wise and within 2 days he was sleeping more and was on a daily  schedule for the first time since coming home from the hospital. He was  happier and so was I. Now about 3 1/2 wks later, he is sleeping through the  night (about 8 hours), eating well, and very happy--so are we! Life has  some organization to it and we are not sleep deprived zombies anymore. He  is more playful and we are enjoying parenthood a lot more. As for the  concerns that this approach will reduce weight gain--not so. My son has put  on almost 10 lbs since birth and the doctor is extremely pleased with his  growth. Some also think that you have to let them cry, but my child has not  had to at all. Sometimes I let him fuss a little which my doctor told me I  could do from the start--but he has never &quot;cried it out&quot;. We know  several parents who tried this and it has worked for all of them. Hope it  works for you too!	2000-04-26	4

My husband felt the book gave little advice on how  he could play an active role in our daughter's life, other than to hold  things together if I invariably broke down. This book was of no help  whatsoever in transitioning from the home to daycare.  Clearly, the authors  do not approve of mothers who work outside the home.

This book is THE book for parents who want happy,secure, well fed and well rested children that are a joy to be around for both the parents and others. My child is now 10 months old. He is breastfed and the routine  described in Babywise has allowed me to continue despite my return to work  when he was 3 months. I began using the sleeping principles when he was 5  weeks old and within 3 days he was sleeping comfortably through the night.  Now he loves his bed and bedtimes are NEVER a problem.  I was afraid to  allow him to cry at first but when I did he cried only 8 minutes the first  time--- poor baby was so sleep deprived because I was trying so many  attachment parenting priciples that he was fussy all the time and never  getting really good sleep.  The hardest thing was allowing crying but I  sincerely feel that it is a very natural part of parenting and the book  clearly explains when to respond to a cry and when it may be best not to.  This book explains in detail how to establish sleeping and feeding routines  that teach good habits for a lifetime.	2000-04-24	4

They said their children responded beautifully to it and were sleeping through the night relatively early.  Naturally, I was intrigued.  I bought the book  - the whole series actually - and read it carefully.  Twice.  The concept  sounded great.  Too bad not all babies are alike.<br />When my baby was about  five weeks old, I decided it was time that he learn to sleep in his crib  during the day.  He had always slept there at night, but took naps all day  long on visiting family members that wanted to spend time with him.   Babywise indicated that babies on a 2 1/2 to 3 hour schedule, which my baby  was on (not because I planned it that way, but because that is when he was  hungry) ought to take naps of about 1 1/2 hours.  So, after I fed him, I  would keep him up a bit and then put him in his crib, awake, for his nap.   I expected some crying, but according to the book, I should notice a  pattern to the cries and they were not supposed to last too long.   Additionally, after three to five days, the baby was supposed to be trained  and go down for naps without much fuss.  It never worked.  There was never  a pattern to his cries.<br />I stuck to the plan religiously for three days.   There were days that my baby cried through his entire naptime.  When it  came time to eat, he was too exhausted to finish his meal and fell asleep  while I was nursing him.  Within about fifteen minutes of falling asleep,  he was start crying again.  As instructed in the book, I let him cry.  I  listened for a pattern in the cry, but there never was one.  My baby was  ready to eat in time intervals less than what he was eating before because  he did not have enough energy to finish his meal.  My content and alert  baby became cranky and lethargic.  His constant crying contributed to the  build-up of intestinal gas, which was what was causing him to wake up in  the middle of his naps.  Of course I did not realize this until I watched  him sleep on the day I abandoned the program.  He woke up grunting,  breathing heavily and screaming.  Occasionally, he would pass gas and the  cries would subside.  The thought that I let my baby cry endlessly when he  was in pain breaks my heart because it represents wasted time I could have  been spending with my baby conforting him.  He was also waking up more  times during the night because he was hungry more frequently.  Since I  abandoned the program, my baby is more content, sleeps better, is able to  finish his entire meal, an is alert for some time after it.  For me,  Babywise backfired.  It was supposed to contribute to babies who ate at  regular times and who were more content.  Instead, my baby became cranky  because he was not getting enough sleep, and ate irreguarly because he was  too tired to get a full feeding.  <br />There is a time and place for  &quot;crying it out&quot;.  I recently read Ferber's book, but he  recommends that the system be used for older babies about five to six  months old.  The point of sleep training is trying to get a baby to go to  sleep on his own, not to see how long a baby can cry.  A much gentler  approach is putting a baby down in his crib while his eyes are droopy but  he is still awake, so for the last few seconds or minutes, he puts himself  to sleep.  That has worked wonders for my baby and he is no longer scared  of being in his crib.  If he continues to wake through the night as he gets  older, then we will probably try the Ferber method to break him of that  habit.  But for now, he is learning to go to sleep on his own, without  crying for hours.<br />I would urge parents who are interested in this method  to watch their babies.  I believe there would have been significant health  consequences for my baby had I not abandoned the program.  For example, he  had been having regular bowel movements, but during the time period I  employed the Babywise plan, he stopped having regular bowel movements.Once I abandoned it, he was back to normal.  It probably had something to  do with the fact that he was not eating well.  If parents are willing to  try this plan, then I wish them luck, but not to the detriment of their  babies health.	2000-04-20	4

I have a 2 1/2 year old and a 9 week old. A friend loaned me this book, she's not getting it back, when my 9 week old was 6 weeks. After I read the book I immediately started the routine. My baby responded positively to it  right away. The second night she dropped her middle of the night feeding,  permanently. She is a very happy and content baby, smiling and cooing  constanly.  After demand feeding my first child, never knowing why she was  crying, and being very stressed out, I feel the weight of the world has  been lifted from my shoulders.  The advice in this book is so enlightening.  Especially after only hearing the cliches &quot;You can't hold your baby to  much&quot; and &quot;You can't love your baby too much.&quot;  With my  first child I read lots of parenting magazines and parenting books that all  eluded to the same cliches. I was searching for another way because I was a  basket case, just ask my husband. Different people I know kept telling me  to just let my baby cry a little but they offered no good reasoning, and  that was not good enough for me. I wanted to &quot;do it right&quot; and  the only advice I could find was the current thinking. This book has given  the history of where these current beliefs and cliches have come from and  why. These authors have given sound and common sense reasoning behind their  advice.  I could identify with almost everything in their book regarding  child centered parenting because I lived it with my first child. There is a  better way! My whole family is happier and much more stable because of the  advice in this book. I call this a best kept secret because I never would  have found it on my own.	2000-04-06	4

The most useful information in it was that babies enter light sleep first, then deep sleep. This explained why my 3 week old was exhausted; he was capnapping all day -  light sleep only - because I was carrying him around with me everywhere.  Within a day of beginning Babywise his fussing was cut in half. No wonder;  he was rested. While I wouldn't say we've followed everything in the book  to the letter, it does work. I fail to understand the controversy  surrounding the advice given in this book. I think most of the people  complaining of these methods have never tried them; they are envisioning a  screaming baby alone in a crib. My 9 week old son does occasionaly fuss  when I put him in his crib to sleep. Usually, it's because he's had an  especially active and stimulating &quot;up time&quot;, and is a little  overtired from it. I would never dream of letting him lie in his crib  screaming himself to sleep. That's not what the book recommends. Instead,  he may wail a few times, and then go to sleep on his own. Finally, a note  to the reviewer who mentioned that several parents have sued the authors,  as proof that the book is an example of thinly disguised child abuse. I'm a  lawyer, and believe me, that means NOTHING. Do you really think that the  fact a lawsuit is filed means that the complaint is based in reality? Take  a good look at the world around you - only a plaintiff's attorney would  have you believe that is the case.	2000-04-02	4

When the author's guidelines are used sensibly,  nothing could be further from the truth.  The first two months of my son's  life, I fed my son at the slightest whimper, without stopping to evaluate  whether he was hungry, tired, lonely, bored etc.  I rocked him to sleep for  2 hours every night and was up at least twice to feed him, and we were all  generally exhausted and miserable.  Babywise helped us develop a FLEXIBLE  routine that brought order to our lives and insured that our son had  regular, good feedings, had &quot;playtime&quot; when he got non-feeding  attention, and insured that we all got enough rest.  The book advocates  evaluating and monitoring your child's need and in no way advocates  neglect!  Did we follow every single recommendation of the book to the  letter?  Of course not, we used our own good judgment and common sense and  adapted the method for our child's needs.  While this method may not be for  everyone, the book's principles can help give you and your child the  security and predictability of a routine, and I would recommend reading it  and trying it out for yourself.  I agree with another reader who said  &quot;the proof is in the pudding&quot; - we have a happy, thriving, 9  month old who is off the growth charts, sleeps all night, naps twice a day  and is a joy to be around.	2000-03-28	4

I have used this book and recommend it to many parents. I give it as a baby shower gift.  The  principle of scheduled feedings every 2-4 hours depending on infants age  and needs regulates and stabilizes blood sugars, thereby decreasing  irritability and fussiness in infants. Regular scheduled feedings insure  against dehydration and malnutrition as opposed to irregularity of demand  feeding. All babies in the NICU are placed on strict feeding schedules, how  can this be good for them if it is supposedly dangerous for a healthy  full-term newborn?  The AAP for hundreds of years recommended feeding  schedules for infants and now they want you to think its dangerous. There  is nothing rigid or strict in a feeding schedule unless you make it that  way.  This book teaches parents to nurture and love their children and to  respond to their needs/cries appropriately instead of giving the  bottle/breast or pacifier immediately. It teaches parents to be more in  tune with their babies individual needs.  It teaches new parents to trust  themselves , that they do know what is best for their child.  This type of  parenting is not for everyone.  Some people can not fit schedules into  their busy lifestyles, that's ok.  Many will find this parenting style a  great blessing.	2000-03-26	4

Gary Ezzo advocates using your &quot;common  sense&quot; and not be so rigid that you follow the schedule to the minute!

Top pediatricians and leading children's magazines have come out strongly against this book and the Babywise system has sent several babies to the hospital.  Some of the messages and beliefs are appealing, and the schedules themselves seem fine.  Having a parent centered household is a  value I share and getting my kids on schedules was very helpful for all of  us.  Following this method strictly can be a dangerous way to achieve those  goals, though, so please  consult your pediatrician before rigidly applying  this system.  <br />The main problem with the system is that it teaches  parents to ignore their baby's cries for hunger.  If you let a hungry baby  cry too long she can get so upset that she can't eat when the clock says it  is time.  And it doesn't take very long for an infant to become dehydrated.   Some children can go on feeding schedules like these just fine.  Both of  my children had reflux, though, which caused them to need very frequent  small feedings.  By the time they were six months old and medicated I could  gradually move them onto a feeding and sleeping schedule (fairly similar to  a Babywise one) just fine with no crying.  <br />There can be other physical  reasons why children need more frequent or less regular feedings and some  of those things (like growth spurts) can change over time.  If you are  breast feeding it is much more important that you respond with some  flexibility to your infant's cues to maintain your milk supply.     <br />Secondly, research has shown that babies who are less than 5-6 months  old are unable to learn to put themselves to sleep.  So while my friend  (who followed this book) found her baby did go to sleep after a half hour  of crying, he ALWAYS cried at least a half hour and it never decreased.   She was pleased with the schedule and luckily he was an adaptible and not  very sensitive kid so he wasn't hurt.  Some children respond very poorly to  this treatment.  After about 6 months many babies can learn to put  themselves to sleep and the crying then diminishes rapidly.  If your baby's  crying at bedtime doesn't diminish within a couple days she either isn't  ready or isn't able to learn from crying herself sleep.  <br />Also, small  babies are just not smart enough yet to be manipulative--they just ask for  what they need.  So you should not feel that responding to a crying infant  will lead to a spoiled teenager. <br />If you read this book please discuss it  with your pediatrician before applying the methods strictly.  Working  towards a schedule can be very helpful for the whole family.  But always  apply your common sense and listen closely to your baby.	2000-03-23	4

And it does have some good advice, but in practice, for some babies, it stops short child abuse.  Not all babies are alike, more sensitive or tempermental babies should NOT  be forced onto this program!  I put my 7 week old on this program for 24  hours, I followed it to the letter.  It resulted in a baby that ate half of  her normal intake and a baby that was so traumatized that she became jumpy  and frightened at the slightest of sounds made.  Be an informed parent!  If  you have any reservations about this program, DO NOT use it!  For those  that have highly sensitive babies, I recommend that you read and use the  techniques in &quot;Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child&quot; by Marc  Weisbluth, MD.

Babies need consistency, as any parent knows, and the routines suggested in Babywise  provide that consistency.  My baby is drinking as much as the AAP  recommends for her weight and height, and has been on a 4-feedings/day  schedule since just less than 3 months old.  She only dehydrates when she  is sick, and at that time, we alter her routine to make sure she is getting  enough nutrients and liquids to get through the stuffy nose that makes  nursing so difficult.  I especially approved of Babywise's focus on  nursing.  It is true that your baby can be sleeping through the night by 10  weeks, even on breast-milk!  The new revised version of this book is very  thorough in explaining exactly what things you must be firm on and what  things can vary a little.  Overall, the only thing I found hard to get  through was the great amount of philosophy in the chapters.  But, even  though I didn't agree with every single thing in the book, I found the main  idea to be of great worth.  Most importantly, that the authors urge the  reader to get to know their baby (as each baby is unique): know their cries  and what they need at a given situation.  When your baby is on a schedule,  you are able to know why they are crying at a given time because you know  when it is time to eat, when they are most likely tired, and when they are  crying out of the ordinary for reasons such as sickness or teething.  I  would urge anyone who cares about the well-being of their baby, as well as  their own needs to buy this book, study it, and apply it.	2000-03-16	4

My mom has been a nurse for 35 years, but  couldn't really provide any help or advice since she didn't breast-feed any  of my brothers or sisters.  Whether you breast or bottle feed, the  information presented in this book seems well explained and backed by the  experience of many parents.	2000-03-16	4

I have heard and helped with more sleep issues then you will ever dare to imagine. I will say I have recommended many methods for many  different parents and children. Some respond better to some things, and  others to something totally different. I love parenting/sleep books by  William Sears, as well as believing that Ferber works better for other  families. But this book shocked and saddened me. This whole parenting  philosophy just horrifies me! Babies on a feeding schedule? The AAP  (American Academy of Pediatrics) CLEARLY recommends against this. Babies  need to be demand fed and while enduring illness, growth spurts, stress,  etc. may NEED to be fed every 2 hours. I cannot understand where the Ezzos  (NOT doctors) get their feeding and medical advice. The ONLY pediatrician  to advise on this book was a young man with NO children himself, just  starting out! I agree not all parents will be comfortable with sleep  sharing, sling wearing, etc. I wasn't. BUT let my newborn/baby cry? Train  her? My child is a person, a human. I would not do thos to my PETS, let  alone my children. Parents read this book, get a false sense of security.  They wonder why their child is not follwoing this book, why their child is  still screaming, why their child is losing weight, dehydrated, become  withdrawn, etc. As a nurse I HIGHLY recommend against this book. Not only  has it landed many babies in the hospital, it's brought feelings of guilt,  failure, stress and sadness to many. Not all babies are alike. Parents need  to tailor an approach for them and their child. You cannot train a child,  you can teach and help them. This book says and recommends things my  Grandmother, a proper English mom of 13, was saddened by. None of the  pediatricians I know recommend this book and all caution against it. I'd  sterr clear of 2 overly preachy parents trying to make a dollar at the risk  of your child/baby. I'd recommend reading books by William Sears, Penelope  Leach, Ferber, and others to gather some ideas and sleep methods...then  follow what works best for you and your child. However the ideas in this  book are nothing short of dangerous and should not be used.	2000-03-13	4

We have found it to be invaluable. You will read many reviews on this web site that insist that this book is a handbook for neglect and child abuse, but this is patently  absurd. Most of these people simply have a philosophical opposition to  scheduling and prefer to feed their children whenever they cry. This, of  course, assumes that children nearly always are crying because they are  hungry and that they are always hungry when they are eating. Neither of  these assumptions is true. Our experience has been that &quot;demand  fed&quot; babies will &quot;snack&quot; off and on all day and often all  night. Scheduled babies, on the other hand will eat fully at their  scheduled times and not be hungry in the intervals. This book advocates a  very reasonable, common sense approach to scheduling and doesn't encourage  anyone to become a slave to a schedule. Schedules can and should be altered  at times to meet the specific needs of the baby, and every baby is, of  course, unique.	2000-03-11	4

First, a baby should not be sleeping through the night at seven weeks.  A child still needs nourishment every two to three hours at that age.  The American Academy of Pediatrics  suggests that a baby should sleep through the night at three to four months  and the child will do it naturally NOT because you allowed them to scream  themselves into exhaustion.  If you don't want to be awaken in the middle  of the night do not have a baby.  Also the schedules are too rigid and  don't allow for alterations.  Use your best judgement and consult with your  baby's doctor. Skip over this book entirely.	2000-03-07	4

I don't to write a big review stating what others have already said so I'll just say that those who are in favor of this book are exactly right.  Both my kids slept through the night by 7 weeks and they never went hungry.   The doctor that my firstborn was seeing didn't like that I followed a  schedule and predicted that my child would be underweight.  Well, she was  in for quite a suprise when my baby exceeded her birthwieght at 1 week of  age.  I like structure and followed a schedule from day one.  Some people  don't like schedules and the author points out that this is not meant to be  legalistic.  It is a routine and all that means is that there is a repeated  pattern.  You don't HAVE to do everything at the exact same time every day.   In fact they mention that if you have no flexibility in your baby's  routine you are not using the plan correctly because you are probably  ignoring your baby.  Anyway, I love Babywise and I recommend it to everyone  I know.  I have very happy kids.  They are well fed, obedient and pleasant.   And as the others who support this book have said- if you read it and try  it and you don't like, don't do it.	2000-02-29	4

Most of the negative reviews seem to come from folks who either have limited reading comprehension or simply don't read the book at all.  <br />My interpretation of Ezzo's thoughts certainly don't seem cruel or unkind to an infant, and  MOST certainly do not involve any form of neglect!  Any person that thinks  otherwise is either stupid or ignorant!  Stupid, I can't help you with, but  if ignorance is your problem, read the book!  <br />After reading this book,  and applying the basic principles suggested, it seems absolutely absurd to  think that some folks consider it cruel.  How can applying some stability  to a child's life in this otherwise crazy world be a bad thing?  Our child  gets as much cuddling, baby-talk, ooggling, etc. as any baby, but he also  sleeps through the night, wakes up every morning cooing (not crying).   <br />Seems to me the people that have read the book, applies some of the  principals with reason, logic, and most of all, common sense, are happy and  have happy, well-behaved children!  I have recommended this book to many of  my friends, and let me finish with one last comment:<br />There are just as  many pediatricians, family practice doctors, parents, and other  &quot;professionals&quot; that attest to the reasonableness of Ezzo's book  as there are who disclaim its merit.	2000-02-28	4

HOWEVER, let me say that I tried the principles in the book with my infant, and he was a miserable, hungry, tired little baby.  He  really did need to breastfeed more than the book would 'allow'.  I don't  find the information militaristic, after all, you could take the advice or  leave it... noone is MAKING you follow the book word for word.  However, as  a new mother who hasn't been exposed to children beforehand, the book did  make me start thinking along the lines of schedules and routine.  I just  took it as a guide of sorts, not as a strict regime.  I've heard from  friends who had babies that responded well to the program, and apparently,  for some kids, it really does work, and works well enough that the book was  recommended to me by several people.<br />As a side note, I read somewhere  that the reason why the book now includes warnings about dehydration is  that the earlier editions didn't include them, and babies were winding up  in the hospital due to dehydration, and parents were suing Ezzo.	2000-02-28	4

The explanations of the feed-wake-sleep cycle were invaluable to understand the needs of a baby.  My baby was born  13 weeks early.  I didn't even begin to &quot;use&quot; this book until he  was 21 weeks old (already 7 weeks &quot;corrected&quot; age).  He took  immediately to the play and nap routines.  He was happier knowing he was  going to have a nap when he was tired, and he always woke up happy.  He was  never &quot;alone and neglected&quot; in his room as other reviewers have  written.  Perhaps they misinterpreted this book.  Of course, he spends time  alone in his room when napping or during quiet playtime.  Parents who think  that their babies need parental attention 24 hours a day are not reading  properly their babies'signals.  Even babies need &quot;alone&quot; time.   My baby never cried when put down for a nap, and never woke up crying.   When he grew hungry, I fed him, even it was &quot;early,&quot; but the  point of the book's theory is that, for the most part, your baby will be  hungry at roughly the same times, so that both the parent and the baby know  what the baby wants and when.  It is better than parents who feed a baby  every time it cries, whether or not it's hungry, merely because they don't  know what else to do.  My baby is always happy, I comfort him when he needs  me, and he knows how to comfort himself.  I love him with everything that I  am and I think parents need to think for themselves and not blame their  babies' dehydration, etc. on a book.	2000-02-26	4

It is every parents responsibility to take in information, observe their child and decide what is best for their child.  This philosophy of parenting is  not designed to be militaristic, but it is designed to be structured.  If  you are not a structured person, then do not use this method.  If you are  and you value sleep, then give it a try.  If your child doesn't take to it,  then stop!   The authors are very clear to outline the danger signs of a  baby who is either dehydrated or not growing properly. You should be  observant and make sure that your child is not suffering from those  symptoms.  The authors also make it very clear that this is a process and  if your child is clearly hungry (even if it is early) then FEED HIM. I  think any lawsuits that have been brought against the authors can be  classified as frivolous.  Ultimately parents are responsible for their  children's well being not the author of a parenting advice book.   If you  are interested in scheduling your child's feedings, then read the book and  decide for yourself.  Gary Ezzo is not God, nor does he claim to be.  Use  good sense, observe your child closely and make the best decision for your  family.  I have a six month old and it worked for a charm for us.  She was  sleeping through the night at 4 weeks.  However, we never deprived her of  food if she was hungry, but with a schedule it was easier to deduce what  the problem was when she cried.  It worked for her, we will try it again,  if it doesn't work for our next child, then we won't use it.  Please, take  responsibility for your own family.  This book is merely advice, and I  think the majority of it is good advice.	2000-02-22	4

However, my 2 breastfed children responded differently.  I learned about the book when my first baby was 5 weeks old. She was a pretty good night sleeper (6  hours) but had difficulty with naps.  At 7 weeks I tried it and it took 3  DAYS for her to establish the eat-wake-sleep routine.  What a difference  that made in our days!  Now, at 18 months she naps twice for about 90  minutes each during the day and sleeps 12 hours at night.  With that  success, I decided to try it with my son right from the start.  He was a  different baby, of course, and I was very unsuccessful at the beginning. So  I gave up temporarily. When he was 5 weeks old I tried the routine again.  It took him about 10 days to really get the hang of the eat-wake-sleep but  when he did it was wonderful.  He slept through the night at 8 weeks and  now at 17 weeks takes 3 2-hour naps during the day and sleeps 11 hours at  night. I can work my activities around their naps so that their waketime is  filled with fun and love and my undivided attention!  I read the negative  reviews and do not agree with most of them.  This worked for us! Good Luck!	2000-02-17	4

The  strict, militaristic style, is not our way of parenting.  I guess I'm just  a softee, but love, physical contact and responsiveness worked well for us.   Our baby was sleeping 6 hrs at night by day 8 and through the night at  three weeks.<br />My message:  many things work; think for yourself.<br />In laws  of ours have raised three children strictly following the methodologies in  this book. Yes, their children quickly slept through the night and were  predictable with feedings. <br />I have witnessed these children at five,  three and one years old.  All three are very inflexible.  Family activites  revolve around their nap times and meals.  No all day trips to the park,  holidays are scheduled around them and moving to a new home has been a  nightmare for this family. These children relied on a predictable schedule  and now &quot;freak out&quot; at deviations. What was a convenience for  their parents in the early days, has become a temendous burden  now.<br />Unfortunatley the world does not stop for our beloved children (even  if we think it should!)  Part of a parent's job is to help a child become  confident in their own abilities, handle change, adapt and grow; not just  mold them to what we want them to be.<br />When you are sleep deprived, you  will try anything, but don't make &quot;Baby Wise&quot; a way of life.	2000-02-17	4

He happened  to be an active infant that fussed himself to sleep every nap and night for  11 months, this book saved us from going crazy about it and giving us ideas  to help.

Other mothers  I know that use this system have also had great success. My second baby is  4 days old and we are starting to put her on a schedule as well. Just the  idea of knowing what to expect is invaluable; if she just ate 2 hours ago,  then the crying indicates something other than hunger and I can investigate  other possibilities for her discomfort.

A close friend of mine shared the book with me and since she had 3 great kids, I thought I'd try it when my time came. Since then many of my friends have  used the principles in Babywise, with excellent results.  <br />When it came  my turn to be a new Mom, I eagerly read the book and was excited to use it  with my newborn.  Yes, it did work and yes, she slept through the night at  8 weeks (she's 9 months now) and yes, she has been sleeping 12 hours a  night since and no she doesn't cry when I lay her down and yes, she is  extrememly happy and receives a ton of love and attention.  People always  comments on how &quot;lucky&quot; we are to have such a great, happy baby.  I just say &quot;thanks&quot;. But, I know it takes work and dedication to  raise great kids, no matter what parenting style you use.  <br />There seems  to be 2 types of people. One type, love the book and would recommend it.  The other type usually hate it and recommend Dr. Sears.  If that's your  choice then go with it. No one parenting style is going to work for every  person. It's ridiculous to think that.  Babywise worked for us!  Dr. Sears  would not have worked for us.  I won't judge you for doing Dr. Sears and  you don't judge me for loving Babywise.  <br />Do I follow the book to the  letter? No, the good Lord gave me a brain and I do use it. There's only one  book I would follow to the letter and that's the Bible (which is another  discussion).  I've read many books on parenting and Babywise was the one  that worked for us. Parent-Directed feeding and having her a routine was  some of the best advice I was giving.  I share the book with all my friends  (but, I don't look down on the if they choose not to use it).  Most people  that I've given to book to, come back later and thank me.  I love my child  and would do anything for her. I would recommend this book to any new  parent.  If you don't like, then don't use it. But, don't be so quick to  judge others.	2000-02-11	4

As a step mom to 3, birth mom to 3, foster mom to 50 and adoptive mom to 2, we as a family have benefitted from the principles outlined in Baby Wise.  The greatest thing about this country is the freedom of speech, and  thank God we have the ability to make parenting decisions instead of a  gov't mandated plan.  <br />Baby Wise encourages parents to think for  themselves, to consider where the baby is in their day, and respond  accordingly.  Feeding your baby and meeting his/her needs is  encouraged.<br />It's interesting that Dr. David Satcher, The U.S. Surgeon  General just said on Oprah (1/27/00) that &quot;In the last decade, obesity  has doubled in children.&quot;  Could there be any connection to the demand  feed philosopy?  When a baby is in the hospital nursery, do those nurses  provide a basic routine, (i.e. schedule) or are they given a bottle  anywhere from 2 and 1 /2 to 3 and 1/2 hours apart?  This is the guidelines  for PDF babies outlined in this book.  By keeping regular appointments with  your Pediatrician, and using the Healthy Growth charts, parents have a  safety net.  <br />As foster parents, we have seen the effects of child abuse,  and it is not a pretty sight.  To make allegations of child abuse is very  serious.  In my nine years of foster parenting, primarily infants and  toddlers, we have found the principles of Baby Wise to be very helpful.  No  where do I find support for child abuse, nor would I condone  it.<br />Honestly, we do support the material in Baby Wise, and believe that  each of us have the right to make assessments on what we feel works for us.  When we build one another up, not tearing down we will look more like the  Giver of Life.  Babies are blessings!	2000-02-08	4

Although this book came highly recommended from a friend who had used the Baby Wise method successfully to help their child sleep through the night, I didn't expect anything to work for my newborn triplets. My confidence in  the author was boosted however when I read that he was the father of  triplets as well! Before implementing the Baby Wise system our triplets  were being fed &quot;on demand&quot;, and as you might imagine, this  resulted in our caring for them 24 hrs a day... Someone always needed to be  awake. We implemented the Baby Wise system on a Monday... and by Thursday  ALL THREE of my triplets slept THROUGH THE NIGHT! Our lives were saved!  Once we put them on a schedule my babies were happier and healthier than  ever. They slept better, they ate better and they quickly learned to soothe  themselves. Some reviewers of the book have suggested that this method is  cruel. I couldn't disagree more.

We take some and we leave some.  We are definitely &quot;leaving&quot; this.  I realize that there are many acceptable ways to  parent a child, but my training as a psychologist and my instincts as a  parent tell me that the methods in this book are simply not acceptable.   <br />Stop and think for a moment.  The ONLY way that an infant can  communicate his or her needs is to cry.  This book suggests that we should  ignore our children's requests for basic human needs.  Would we ignore a 3  year-old if he asked for food, simply because it's convenient for us?  I  certainly hope not.  An earlier reviewer said that his/her baby cried for  an hour the first night, and it got much better from there.  Of course it  did.  The baby quickly learned that crying-- the only way that he could  communicate--wouldn't get his needs met.  Instead, he learned to just lay  there and feel the discomfort of hunger, fear, or whatever it was he was  feeling.  I don't see how this sort of behavior can inspire trust between a  parent and a child.<br />My baby is going through a fussy period right now.   My husband and I are tired, but we give our baby what he needs when he asks  for it.  When we signed on as parents, we knew that we would be frustrated  and sleep deprived for a while.  Parenting is not about convenience.  Sure,  we put him in his cradle once when we were particularly frustrated, and let  him cry for quite a while.  It was horrible.  Tears were streaming down his  face and he was choking on his cries.  I picked him up, held him close, and  he was okay.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that babies  need warmth, touch, and basic human contact to feel secure.<br />The authors  of this book suggest that we should let babies &quot;cry it out&quot; and  put them on schedules.  These are very Western concepts.  Other cultures  carry their infants most of their young lives, and they doquite well.  I  wonder if the authors would suggest that we help our grade schoolers with  their homework by sending them to their rooms and telling them to figure it  out on their own.  <br />If you are struggling with your infant, as all  parents do, consider something different. I love all of the books that  Sears and Sears have written.  Try them.  They are written by people who  clearly love children, take a positive, nurturing approach, and who have a  knack for making you feel good about yourself as a parent.  By the way,  their methods will probably require more time and commitment on your part.   But that's what parenting is all about, isn't it?	2000-02-03	4

I demand-fed my two boys and they didn't sleep through the night until they were 7 &amp; 8 months old. I followed the guidelines in &quot;Baby Wise&quot; and my baby daughter has not only  slept through the night since she was 5 weeks old, she is happy and content  and goes down for naps without a fuss! Sleeping through the night is not  just good for a happy Mom--it makes a well-rested, happy baby too! My baby  is 4 months old now and has been sleeping from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. since she  was 3 months old. I also was not able to breastfeed my boys successfully,  but she is nursing beautifully. Again, I believe this is because I  demand-fed them, let them &quot;snack&quot;, they didn't get a good, solid  feeding each time, so they were continually hungry and fussy. As the book  recommends, I always make sure she gets a full feeding and I am thrilled to  be able to successfully nurse my baby this time! I was totally  anti-scheduling with my first two, but with the results I have with my  third baby, I am a true convert! Don't get this book for your sake, get it  for your baby's sake.

Mr. Ezzo does not take in consideration the needs of a baby.  Babies have growth spurts and need to feed when they are hungery.  It is neglectful to follow Mr. Ezzo's guidelines for feeding a baby under six months of age.   Babies learn to trust their parents when  parents respond to baby's cries and needs.  Babies cannot tell time and  will not learn to trust a parent who puts a baby on a schedule disregarding  the baby's needs.	2000-01-26	4

Anyone searching for a manual of Christian parenting will please not stop on this book.  There are many Christian parents who are appalled and quite frankly, frightened, by this method of child rearing.  These are the facts  about &quot;Baby Wise&quot;:<br />1.  It is not medically safe.  Parent  directed feeding has been denounced worldwide by physician groups and  hospitals.  Babies die from malnutrition and dehydration when this schedule  is rigidly enforced.  I don't care that Ezzo (who has no medical training)  cautions against rigidiity - it simply isn't safe.   2.  It isn't  phsychologically safe.  Mental health professionals are beginning to  understand the detrimental ramifications of creating this kind of distance  between a parent and child.  Needs that go unmet in infancy and childhood  have a liklihood of recurring with more dangerous proportions later (e.g.,  drug addictions, gang affiliations).  No, I am not making this up. 3.  Do  NOT believe the given profile of parents and children not affiliated with  this practice.  The opposite of this approach, attachment parenting, does  NOT advocate letting children rule their parents' lives or not disciplining  children.  It is a way of knowing and connecting to your child in such a  manner that discipline is largely a matter of mutual respect and TRUST  between a parent and child.  Attachment parented children are not the  spoiled brats that Ezzo would like you to believe.  It is quite the  opposite, in fact. 4.  Ezzo offers no positive medical or phsychological  rationale for his philosophy because none exists.  This is parenting by  convenience, but, unfortunately, children are by no means convenient. 5.   This method &quot;works&quot; (babies do sleep through the night, eat, nap,  and play on a schedule that makes life much easier, I'm sure), but that is  because, like Pavlov's dogs, human beings are quite adaptable creatures.   It is the emotional expense of this adaptabiltity that is frightening. 6.Christianity and &quot;God's Way&quot; of raising children has NOTHING to  do with the contents of this book.  Don't be fooled.<br />This book is  frightening, unsafe, and has the potential to become an epidemic if parents  don't filter this information through their brains AND their hearts.   Remember that your baby and child have no one else to depend on - don't  desert him/her because you want a good night's sleep.	2000-01-26	4

Most of the proponents know it is, too, or they wouldn't fill their reviews with phrases like, \\"who cares who says it's child abuse?\\" or \\"it is NOT child abuse.\\"       This book is premised on the idea that there is a rivalry between parent and child, and that it is impossible to fulfill a child's basic needs -- even a newborn's needs -- without somehow causing deprivation to the parent. The practices urged by this book, which is not written by pediatricians or child development experts, deprive newborns and infants of parental contact and food that are essential to development and life, and create a punitive atmosphere that is as unnecessary as it is cruel.     In fact, parenthood is an awesome enough responsibility, with enough fodder for conflict (but not, God help us, when they are infants), without beginning your relationship with your child in such a brutal way.     There are many informative sources for parents about child-rearing: the What to Expect Books, the Gessell Institute Series, Penelope Leach, the American Academy of Pediatrics or even Dr. Sears. Unlike the Ezzos, the books I've mentioned have been written by folks who have informed, developmentally-realistic expectations about children, and who approach the parent-child relationship from a position of goodwill (even when they don't necessarily agree with each other).	2000-01-24	4

I have  given this book to at least 5 people as shower gifts and they have all been  skeptical but eventually grateful for the simple advise.

This schedule then results in a happy,  well-contented baby that will then learn to sleep through the night at  approximately 8-12 weeks of age. The book points out that the key is the  order of sleep, eat, wake-time.  Like other parents we were putting the  babies to sleep immediately after eating.  After reading Baby Wise, we  changed the order and it worked for us!  Our daughter started sleeping  throught the night at 11 weeks and our son followed suit a week later.  Now  they're 16 weeks old and we've even cut out the late-night (11pm) feeding  and they sleep from 7:30 pm to 6:30-7:00 am.  What a difference this has  made in our lives!<br />With twins, we were both utterly exhausted trying the  demand-feeding style. My wife breast-feeds exclusively and I do all the  shuttling/diaper changing.  But our motivation wasn't just trying to get  more rest for ourselves, Esso's approach just made sense to us.  We also  read Marc Weisbluth's &quot;Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child&quot;, and  highly recommend this book as well.  Weisbluth made us understand how  IMPORTANT a good night's sleep is for a baby.  &quot;Baby Wise&quot; taught  us how to do it. <br />Did our babies cry at first?  Yes, they did.  The  longest our son ever cried was for one hour, the first night.  The second  night was 10 minutes, 3rd night 5 minutes. Our daughter really didn't cry  much at all.  Now, there's rarely any crying at all--just golden silence  while they're sleeping.  They also take 2-3 good naps a day, although nap  consistency has been more of a challenge than the nighttime sleep.  <br />I'm  amused at the &quot;controversy&quot; over this book and the attacks from  the Attachment Parenting camp and the accusations of &quot;child  abuse&quot;.  My opinion is that it is much more harmful to your children  if they are chronically exhausted, (not to mention the parent's exhaustion)  than a few nights of them crying as they learn to fall asleep on their own.   All I can say is that our twins are happy, well-rested, above-average  height &amp; weight and still get all the love &amp; nurturing that they  need.

He is now 5 months (we've graduated to vol II). Ben now knows when he wakes up, he'll be fed, then he'll play, then nap, etc.  I spent the first 8  weeks always wondering, \\"Why is he crying?  Won't he nap if he's tired?\\"  (No.)  Now Ben has a secure place in which to develop, he TRUSTS that he  will be taken care of.  He doesn't have to cry for anything he needs, but  if he does I know why.  Life isn't perfect, but this predictable  environment is an essential foundation to a calm home life and a happy  baby. <br />True, Ezzo's tone is sometimes annoying, but overall the book is a  great tool. You can see below, the conflict between soothing your child and  letting them cry rages on, and I don't subscribe fully to either. I do feel  that with every week of your baby's life, this plan will be more difficult  to implement without tears.  But if you do it early, it really pays off.

You need to decided indiviually if  you like this book or not.  Check it out from a library if you can.  Once  you read it most of you Im sure will realize the common sense of it.  In a  nut shell the book says to feed your child, keep them up for an hour or so  and then put them down to sleep...to fall asleep on their own, not while a  bottle or breast is in their mouth.  Think of yourself...you eat and dont  normally go directly to bed, within about an hour after eating is when you  could curl up and go to sleep...well its no different with a baby.  You are  still spending quality, caring, loving time with your baby.  I dont see  where people are saying its abuse/neglect.  I just started today with my 2  month old daughter and she is falling right into the routine!

This is what I've had to do with this book. I got this book because a friend of mine said it changed her life.  That, of course, peaked my curiosity, on top of the fact that her 17-month old  knows sign language.  Unfortunately, upon reading the book, that's where my  fascination with Parent-Directed Feeding ended.  My daughter is soon-to-be  8 months old.  I am still solely breast-feeding on a 3-hr. schedule during  the day and one feeding at night. She is a very content and happy baby and  I'm forever getting compliments because of her.  Ezzo leads you to believe  that if you don't follow his plan you will have a miserable, cranky child  who will be avoided by friends and family.  That was insulting. Now, I  don't believe that Ezzo is promoting child abuse but I also don't believe  in allowing babies, most especially newborns, to cry it out.  The idea that  babies cry because they are letting off emotional stress sounds as  ludicrous to me as attachment parenting does to him.  There is a way to put  a child in bed without him being completely awake or completely asleep that  satisfies both parent and child.  A few minutes of winding down, rocking  and singing to a baby is not detrimental.  He may whimper initially when  you put him down, but that is much nicer than howling for an hour, which  Ezzo supports.  I suppose if you can tolerate it and/ or if your baby goes  down and responds well to this kind of parenting, go for it!  My baby likes  her pacifier when she takes a nap and goes to bed at night and she has  since she was a week old.  Ezzo calls a pacifier a sleep prop that should  be done away with, especially at her age.  Aside from dental concerns, I  don't see how a pacifier is any different from a blanket which many PDFers'  kids use.  (PDF-Parent Directed Feeding)  I don't see what's so wrong in  granting a child what comforts him if it s not potentially dangerous,  life-threatening or beyond reason.  I like the idea of a flexible routine:  sleep, feed, and wake time and I commend Ezzo for not being a clock  watcher; however the idea that having a baby is simply like passing the  baton in a relay race (there's no stopping, you just keep on running) seems  absurd. A baby changes one's life whether we like it or not.  Getting back  into a routine takes time.  If more mothers rested and relaxed like they  were supposed to the first several months, it might lessen the frenzy to  get into a schedule.  I don't mean to ignore the working mother, but in her  case for the most part, a caregiver dictates the schedule of the baby  during the day; and as for mothers with other children, in a  child-sensitive household, each child is, in turn, taught to be  parent-sensitive.   In my opinion, the fear that a child will usurp his  parent's authority if his biological clock is not regulated asap by the  parent is an extreme attempt to counter permissive parenting.  For a more  baby-sensitive (versus baby-centered, as Ezzo calls attachment parenting)  ,approach to parenting, specifically Christian parenting, I would recommend  books by William and Martha Sears who not only have years of clinical  experience, but are the proud parents of eight children.  Beware, though,  Ezzo attacks this type of parenting, and yet both Sears and Ezzo claim to  be Christians.  The call is ultimatly yours but I would suggest reading  both views to get a balanced perspective.  Most of all, I would be  confident as a parent to use whatever methods feel right to you and your  child to raise them to be happy, well-adjusted and respectful.	2000-01-11	4

We were both shocked to read a number of reviews of this book which were not only negative, but accusatory.  The basic  tenets of this book are as follows:  Don't let children snack instead of  take a full feeding because they won't get the fatty hindmilk that comes in  the latter part of the feeding; each infant cry is not necessarily one of  hunger or distress - one must learn to distinguish the baby's cries to  determine how to meet her needs; a schedule for baby makes her feel safe  and secure and allows for adequate rest which will contribute to health,  happiness, and growth.  It is obvious that some of the reviewers did not  read the book carefully.  Never does it say not to comfort or soothe your  baby.  Ezzo constantly says to be flexible with the routine to meet your  baby's needs.  Those whose reviews implied that we parents who follow this  routine are selfish, cruel, and child abusing need to reread the book (or  read it carefully for the first time).  If this program does not meet your  needs, don't use it!  However, please refrain from making nasty remarks  with nothing to back them up.  My daughter has gained two pounds in three  weeks, is reaching developmental milestones ahead of schedule, is happy and  content, and is a joy to be with.  I have the confidence (with the help of  Mr. Ezzo's book) that she will grow up in a loving, nurturing environment  as an important member of my family.  She will understand that she is  important, but that there are other people who exist as well.  As a result,  she will learn compassion and understand her place in the world.	2000-01-03	4

Women who follow this regime have poor milk supply, because they are not feeding their babies enough. Breastfeeding is supply and demand. The more you nurse the more milk you  will make. I bet we will see long term studies on this parenting style and  find screwed up kids/adults, who are insecure and have lower IQ's from low  glucose levels to the brain. The first developemental stage is trust versus  mistrust. This book is endorsing mistrust. Babies need thier basic needs  met in order to trust you. Trust that you will come to them when they cry.  Are you stupid enough to think a baby is maniupulating you? They are just  trying to communicate - I am hungry, wet, cold, tired. Go to them, meet  their needs and they will be able to move onto the next developmental  stage.<br /> If you don't want a baby to change your life then don't have  them! They do change your life! Crying is their only way of communicating.  My baby only cries when she has a need to be met, so I meet it and she  stops. She is 3 months old and has slept through the night since six weeks  and I did not use a schedule. I just loved her and nurtured her.She smiles  all the time and is so well adjusted. She is a joy to be with. She sleeps  8-9 hours a night and breastfeeds on demand during the day. She established  her own schedule and it works great for me. As parents we should want what  is best for our baby and not what is conveneient for us! Read 101 ways to  raise a happy baby and books by Dr. Sears on attachement parenting.  <br />Ezzo's ideas will result in poor brestfeeding, mistrust, a feeling of  abandment, and possibly failure to thrive. Ezzo is not a medical  professional, what makes him an expert on babies sleeping and eating  habits? These parents who follow this are selfish and want their babies to  fit into their lifestyle rather than adapting for a new baby.<br />Breastmilk  digests quickly, so babies have to eat often. They are only babies for such  a short time, enjoy that bonding and feeding time, the housework can wait.  Ask any grandmother and she  would say, &quot;treausre every minute and  hold them as much as you can! &quot; <br />Ezzo will have to answer to God  for promoting such awful behavior towards babies. Innocent babies who can  not speak up for themselves. Parents are supposed to love and protect them,  not abandon them in their crib , hungry! Do you want to cry yourself to  sleep? A stress hormone, called cortisol is released while crying. do yu  want a stress hormone building up in your little babies body?<br />If you  don't have the energy to have a few sleepless nights then don't have a  baby!

My mom bought it for me and I read it. I thought it was a bunch of bunk. I was told alot of that stuff from family members but I don't buy it. I spent  many a sleepless night because my son was alone in his crib. At age four  months I got sick of that and put him in bed with my husband and I. We like  him there and it hasn't affected our marriage at all and my son began  sleeping thorugh the night. I also picked him up when he cried. I didn't  run in at the first little peep, but I refused to let him scream and cry.  He just wanted to be held. Personally, I believe this method DOES NOT spoil  a child...it just shows them they are loved and protected. My son is two  now and he has never experienced separation anxiety, is friendly and not at  all shy. If I want to spoil him I will let him get his way all the time.  Loving and holding your child can't spoil them. If people don't want to  have sleepless nights, aren't willing to give up some time, and decide that  scheduling a baby so that their personal and private isn't disrupted in any  way is what's best...they shouldn't not have children. I'm sorry my mom  spent money on this book. Love your children, hold them, hug them, and  enjoy every second you have because someday they'll be to big to rock.	1999-12-04	4

Babywise rates NO STARS at all.<br />Why is training baby to sleep through the night a measure of success as a parent?  This is nuts and Ezzo's methods are anything but natural.  Even Ferber, the originator of baby  sleep training, has spoken out against the methods of Babywise.<br />The  Parent Directed Feeding method described in Babywise elevates the routine  above providing the healthiest nutrition for baby. The spaced feeding  methods advocated in this book contradict everything known about successful  breastfeeding and can directly *cause* low milk supply, forcing mothers who  could otherwise breastfeed exclusively to supplement with, or even switch  to, formula in order to maintain this routine.  This program has been  implicated in cases of failure to thrive and dehydration resulting in  infants being hospitalized.<br />While Dr. Buckman's name lends a measure of  credibility to Babywise, this material (originally published as:  Preparation for Parenting, Bringing God's Order To Your Baby's Day And  Restful Sleep To Your Baby's Night) was authored by Ezzo and his wife, who  have minimal (if any) background in child development.  This lack of  knowledge is evident as they contradict sound medical advice, criticize  other styles of parenting, and misinterpret sound research in favor of  their own ideas.<br />Babywise is anything but *baby* wise.  It has little to  do with order for *baby's* day and rest for *baby's* night.  It is clearly  *parent*-centered and selfish.  It revolves around a grown-up world and  caters to adults who wish to continue their own lifestyle without being  inconvenienced by their children.

I eagerly read Babywise and everything else I could get my hands on before the birth of my son. Everything has to be taken with a grain of salt, but I wholeheartedly recommend Babywise. Ezzo says that providing structure and  routine is critical to making your baby feel safe and secure in his new  world, but he warns against foresaking flexibility in the name of routine.  I followed the basic principles of Babywise and my son has thrived. Not  only did he succeed in sleeping through the night at 8 weeks of age, but  the comfort of a regular routine has allowed him to be extremely adaptable  when the need arises. My son (now 10 months old) is easy to take places,  travel with and most importantly, a joy to be around. In contrast, my  friends who have started with demand-feeding their children every hour (and  sometimes more frequently than that) are now dealing with toddlers who are  telling their parents what to do, can't be left in church nurseries, and  don't understand why Mommy can't stop nursing the new baby to get him a  toy! I truly believe that when children aren't taught to be part of a  family unit (whatever that means in your situation), we are setting the  stage for teenagers who don't take responsibility for their actions and  adults who don't function well in society. <br />So much of parenting is  common sense. Any book you read should be taken with a grain of salt and  with the consideration of your child, his/her temperament and special  needs. I have friends who have used Babywise, but fail to use common  sense--these &quot;by the book&quot; people are so wrapped up in the  suggested 2 1/2-3/12 hour feeding intervals they don't pay attention to  their own gut instinct and forget that the book also says to be flexible in  your routine. <br />I enthusiastically recommend Babywise as a starting point  for childrearing to all of my friends.	1999-11-10	4

As for  my daughter who is 7 now, there are clear signs of her not being on a set  schedule from early on. I am going to apply some of the concepts for her  also. Hopefully she wont be so cranky anymore!	1999-11-07	4

My wife and I began to use the sleeping program when our first son was seven weeks old and within three days he was sleeping through the night (7 hours at first, soon 9-plus hours straight).  Now he  is 6 months and has only awakened once in the night (he had a bad cold) in  the past 4 months!  Amazing.  He is happy and 99th percentile in height and  weight.  I know 15 couples who have tried Ezzo and only one disliked it  (they did so for political reasons).  I've become convinced that demand  feeding, family beds, child-centered homes, etc. are destroying our  children.	1999-11-04	4

When you read any book, you have to add your own common sense and intuition into the mix. I read this book and found it VERY helpful in  establishing a routine for my baby. She appreciated it too. She's thriving!  She started sleeping through the night at seven weeks. She's now seven  months old and is in the 85% for weight and length. She takes regular naps  and eats on a regular schedule. She loves her nighttime routine of a bath  before bedtime. I believe she appreciates knowing what to expect each day.  She is as happy and healthy as any baby could possibly be. I never had to  let her cry herself to sleep--maybe I'm lucky, but, maybe I gained her  trust by responding to her needs. That's what I read in this book. When I  read others extremely negative reviews of this book, I wonder if you  actually read the same book. The authors include several caveats to not  take their guidelines to extremes. Did you not read these parts of the  book? Anyone who can rely on their own common sense will find this book  very helpful.	1999-10-26	4

We have raised her in a calm household with a regular routine and have reaped the results.  She is well behaved, happy, and  stable.  She started sleeping through the night at 7 weeks and now, at age  2, has made the transition into a &quot;big girl bed&quot; with little or  no fuss.  <br />If you don't follow this program, your baby will eventually  sleep through the night, but it will be much later and you will be frazzled  by the time they do.  Research indicates that babies do not need a middle  of the night feeding past 12 weeks.  That means if your six or seven month  old child is still waking up wanting to be fed, it is not a physical  necessity - it's just a habit.  In our experience, friends who have not  followed this program have children who do not sleep through the night  until they are 9 months to a year old.  <br />The best thing about this book  is its emphasis on the family as the important unit- not the child.  It  cautions against &quot;child-centered&quot; families rather than  &quot;family-centered&quot; families.  Everyone's needs are important,  including the parents' need for sleep and time alone.  The baby shouldn't  run the household.  <br />We will follow this program with our second child,  and highly recommend it for new parents!	1999-10-21	4

I bought the Babywise book after having spent a weekend with a family of 5 children!  Most of you will have 'horror' stories already forming in your mind at that statement.  But, to the contrary, they were the most well  mannered, helpful children I've met.  The mother and father were relaxed  with them (even at MEALTIME)!  The ages ranged from 2 to 9, and she was  pregnant again!  I asked them, &quot;What's your secret?&quot;  First, they  said, &quot;God.&quot; Second, they said &quot;We have used the Babywise  method with all five.&quot;  I was pregnant at the time, so I ran to my  computer and bought the book.  <br />On December 27, we had a beautiful baby  boy.  Just over eight weeks later, he was sleeping through the night.  At  five months, he quit fussing to go down for his nap or bedtime.  Though, up  to that point, we had to endure 30 minutes (at least) of fussing.   But, it  was like a switch went off, and he stopped.  Now nighttime is a pleasure,  because we have his bedtime set at 7:15 pm (and he would actually prefer  earlier).  He goes to sleep and wakes up talking and laughing at 7:30 am.   This gives my husband and I the evening to spend time together.  He is also  an amazingly active child.  For example, he has been walking since 8  months.  He has a sweet disposition and is always bright and cheery.<br />I  say all this, because I feel that having him on an appropriate schedule for  his age has been what has helped him to form such good habits.  We have  been consistent, but not rigid with the schedule.  It has made it a breeze  when we've wanted to travel with him.  We know when we need to stop to feed  him, and then we're back on our merry way.  It has taken so much of the  questioning out of being first time parents.  We have felt confident and  rested all through these past nine months.  <br />I have read many reviews  that have proported this book to be the source of making menaces of society  out of our children.  I would challenge those that any of the children I've  met (including my own son), who are on a consistent routine for naps and  meals, are some of the happiest and most well mannered children I've had  the pleasure of being around.  On the other side, most of the mothers with  young children I know, who have no consistent routine for their children,  are tired, harried, and not having a lot of fun.  Often, they are so  focused on their children and meeting their every demand that they have  lost sense of themselves and their relationship with their husband.  <br />I  encourage any new (or not so new) mothers to buy this book and establish a  consistent, age appropriate routine for their child(ren).   For us, it has  made having a child a wonderful, not traumatic, experience.	1999-10-16	4

From the very start everything sounds a little too hokey. Ezzo is not even a child specialist. He is a minister without any background in  child development. He will even credit his wife for the 'child expert'  credentials and she is not even listed as an author of the book. Taking  care of your child this way is not loving or comforting. Ezzo does not  believe that bonding between child and parent exists rather he would like  you to impose a schedule on your child without taking into considering  respect, love and care for your baby. I don't think he has ever really  looked directly into a baby's eyes and seen the maturity and understanding  that a mere infant knows just by the parent holding him and soothing him.  Eventually your child will 'make' his own schedule. Don't rush it--he just  got into this world and is still trying to settle into it!	1999-10-01	4

This book was highly recommended by a number of  my friends -- mostly new, older (mid to late 30's) moms.  It was just what  I needed.

While this book is recommended by many triplet parents, I do not agree.   The ONLY thing I found useful is their ideas on scheduling.  Scheduling is  very necessary to survive having triplets.  But many of the other ideas in  my opinion are not good for babies.  Babies under 6 months should not have  to &quot;cry it out&quot; or be forced to adhere to a parent's schedule,  and there were many other things in this book that sent shivers down my  spine.  Dr. Ferber's techniques are much better, and he is a doctor not a  religious man with an agenda.  The author of BabyWise doesn't mention in  his book that his principles are based on his highly controversial  religious beliefs and practices. If you do decide to get this book, please  take all that he says with your own common sense and a &quot;few huge  grains of salt&quot;.

I came to realize that nothing can replace the  God-given maternal instinct. Although I agree with a good bit of what Ezzo  recommends, I don't believe he is the end-all on child rearing. Dr James  Dobson does not recommend their techniques. I recommend to perhaps read the  book but don't let Ezzo's advice be the last word.

Before reading this book, we were not sure how we would handle parenting.  IT ALL MAKES SENSE!!!  Our Baby Wise baby has been great with  all of the advice of the book.  With scheduling, our daughter has  accomplished so many things.  She began sleeping through the night on a  regular basis at 5 1/2 weeks old.  Amazing, huh?  No, it is not luck.  It  is a system that we had followed.  (This is the same system that worked for  ALL of my sibling's children.  Coincidental, I don't think so.)  This book  offers great guidelines and that is exactly what it is...GUIDELINES!  It  never once says that it has got to be one certain way for ALL children.   But if you work hard, it will work. <br />Not only does our child sleep  through the night and has adjusted well to the meal program, but most of  all, she is happy.  There is not a day goes by that someone doesn't notice  her pleasant demeanor.  At less than six months old, my daughter wakes at 8  am, eats 4 times a day every 4 hours, eats her last meal at 8 pm, takes two  2-hour naps throughout the day, a shorter evening nap, and goes to bed by 9  PM.  Luck...I don't think so.  It was the advise of Baby Wise that got us  to this point.  My daughters Pediatrician compliments our daughters  scheduling of meals and naps.  Our daughter is very healthy!!  <br />We have  really enjoyed parenting and can't wait to do it a second time...thanks to  Baby Wise.  Now we our on our way to buy Baby Wise Part II.	1999-09-15	4

While I was pregnant, I received very little education on what to do with a baby once he was brought home.  After  about a week of no sleep and no idea what we were doing, my husband and I  read this book at the recommendation of a friend.  We immediately started  to use some of the ideas since what we were doing (catering to every cry  and moan of the baby) wasn't working.  Within a couple of weeks, our baby  was going to bed awake, falling asleep in his crib and sleeping with only  one middle of the night waking (2 AM, I remember it well!)  By 8 weeks, he  was sleeping from 8:30 PM to 7:30 AM and he has been a perfect sleeper and  napper for 2 years!  He is happy all the time and when I go to put him down  for a nap or bedtime now, he says &quot;night night mommy&quot;, blows me a  kiss and hugs his Bert and Ernie dolls, rolls up in his favorite  &quot;blankey&quot; and closes his eyes ... no fussing or crying at all!   My friend who told me that this type of child treatment would cause  permanent mental damage was still waking up with her child every night  after she was a year old!  I think that children want discipline and  routine from their parents.  Instead of this program saying &quot;I don't  care&quot; ... it says &quot;I do care and that's why I'm going to the  extra effort to make sure that you get the right amount of sleep and eat at  the right times.&quot;  GREAT BOOK!	1999-09-13	4

I gave a review of Baby Wise on Sep 4 and I just had to second that by saying: Our baby wise baby was 8 weeks old yesterday and slept through the night for the first time.

They sure  don't sound like the opinions of people who actually read the book!  And  also not someone who gave it a fair try.  I am a mother of four and none of  my children have suffered because of a recommended 2-2 1/2 to 3hour max  feeding schedule. You can and should teach your new born to fill their  tummys at feeding time. The little effort it takes to keep your baby awake  to feed well, will more than pay off in the end and should by no means be  looked at as cruel treatment.  They don't suggest Chineese water torture or  any thing. Just loving guidance to help them to achieve what will be a  healthy eating pattern leading to a full tummy and a happy baby awake and a  peaceful baby asleep.  I find it far more cruel to allow your child to  unknowingly create bad eating patterns that lead to poor milk supply and  poor sleep habits.  Because they are just that, habits.  Habits that YOU  are responsible for creating, NOT a new born who doesn't know any better.   You have to take control and teach them. Baby wise is a great tool, Use it.	1999-09-11	4

We have a healthy  baby.<br />I have read a lot of the negative reviews about this book, and most  of them sound like the typical American couple that allows their child to  run the household, rather than the parents doing their jobs correctly.  Doing the right thing is not always easy. But doing the right thing is  always the best thing. These parents are afraid to let their babies cry a  little bit, because they cannot handle conflict. Throughout the child's  life, the parents will always give in to the child. That is why America has  raised a generation of kids that do not respect their mothers or fathers.

I was thrilled to get ahold of a copy of Baby Wise, as I had heard it would solve all of my 4 month old's sleep problems.  Unfortunately, I've had only partial success.  I do believe that the eat, play, sleep schedule  has made my baby somewhat happier and easier, but Ezzo leaves no room for  flexibility (despite his claims.)  My son seems to fight sleeping during  naptime and no amount of &quot;crying it out&quot; gets him to sleep.  He  just stays up and gets crankier and crankier.  Ezzo says: if you put your  baby on a schedule, he'll sleep great and be happy and contented.  But he  never mentions what to do if your child does not settle into a  schedule.I've found that people are either Baby Wise fanatics or  detractors, with few in the middle like me.  I think people assume that  because Baby Wise worked for them, it must work for everyone, and you're  doing something wrong if it's not working for you. OR folks think that  because it didn't work for them, it is a cruel and inhumane way to care for  baby.

This book came highly recommended to me when I was pregnantwith my second child and my first was in the &quot;terribletwos.&quot; When I read it, I was frankly horrified.  These books should be renamed &quot;Parent Convenience Training.&quot; This philosophy is so disrespectful to children.  The overall tone of the book is scary and insidious, but you are cautioned to be &quot;flexible&quot; in following their advise (like &quot;your child will be immoral and out of control if you don't follow the schedule -- but do be flexible!&quot;).  Both of my sister-in-laws are using Ezzo's books (one is using Raising Kids Gods Way -- the same book but with the Biblical justifications for everything).  While their children, one has a one year old and the other a 3 month old, do cry very little and are very docile, I believe this is because they've been left to cry it out so often, they now figure what's the use?  An infant's primary instinct is to survive and if that means adapting to a rigid schedule and being isolated and not allowed to cry in order to be accepted, of course the program will appear to &quot;work.&quot; My one brother and his wife are both business executives and have a nanny who meticulously follows Ezzo's program at their insistence.  The baby often goes days without seeing either of them, since the rigid schedule they have adopted for him calls for him to rise at 7:30 a.m. and go down at 7:30 p.m. and they are usually either putting in extra hours early or late, or travelling. They think being a parent is easy -- and it is for them!  -- But at what price has this come I wonder?  How emotionally healthy will a child grow up to be who receives the message as a tiny infant that, essentially, &quot;I will only love you if you fit into my schedule and do exactly as I direct you to do -- or suffer the consequences&quot;?  So much for unconditionally loving of your children.  Isn't it common knowledge by now that children who are raised by conditionally loving parents end up in therapy (hopefully) or are unable to maintain a healthy, intimate relationship? As a working mother of two, it would have been very convenient to buy into the idea that as long as my new baby was clean and fed, it was o.k. to leave her to cry it out.  However, I knew instinctively, intrinsicly, that this was dead wrong.  I hauled myself into the office many a morning after long nights spent holding and comforting my baby.  But it was worth it. My children, now 5 and 2 are extremely bright, curious, emotionally-healthy, empathetic towards others, well behaved and all-together wonderful. My children speak their minds to my husband and I, but are respectful.  They tell us if they are feeling sad, joyful, silly...whatever.  They are willing and able to articulate their feelings to us because they know our hearts are always open to them and there is no &quot;schedule&quot; to dictate when they may experience our love for them.	1999-08-06	4

The scheduling is so confining that you would be unable to have any life at all. There is no room for flexibility, such as going out of the house to do errands. The strict feeding schedule is  incompatible with hungry babies. Yes, your life will change when your baby  arrives, but you can incorporate the baby into your life. I've read many  parenting books and would recommend &quot;The Baby Book&quot; by William  Sears M.D. and Martha Sears R.N. Also, for breastfeeding mothers, I caution  that by following Ezzo's recommendations for feeding scheduling, you will  in effect be reducing your milk supply and will end up with a crying,  unhappy baby. Follow the AAPs breastfeeding guidelines instead, which are  to breastfeed when the baby shows signs of hunger (not a schedule) and that  crying is a late indication of hunger.	1999-08-01	4

I am very sorry for those people who do have special needs children and should rely on medical advice.  Chances are there were problems prior to beginning  the Baby Wise program.  This book does require the use of common sense.  My  husband and I used this book as a guide.  We did not let our daughter  &quot;scream&quot;.  As the book suggests, if there is  &quot;screaming&quot; going on, then there is other things that need to be  addressed - i.e. is the baby sick?  Perhaps there is a problem with the  mother breastfeeding (letdown problems or just general lack of milk)or for  the formula-fed baby an allergy to the compounds within the formula.   <br />Another question?  As adult, aren't you on a schedule?  Do you get up  for work at the same time every morning, have breakfast, get dressed, drive  to work or catch a car-pool or train?  What happens when you oversleep?   The point is that we are all &quot;scheduled&quot; to some extent.  The  Baby Wise book makes it possible for everyone to be happy.  <br />Three years  later, my husband and I are still very happy with the results.  Our  daughter is very happy, very healthy, polite, and well disciplined.  And  you know what?  We don't need to &quot;spank&quot; our daughter, she  responds the first time to voice command!  I feel it is a very loving thing  to keep your children safe and keeping them respectful of others.  I have a  great love and bond for our daughter.

I read the book prior to having my first baby and felt so much  more confident about bringing her home because we had some idea of how we  would try to do things.  I won't say it was always easy, but we knew what  we needed to do to help her develop and it has been a beautiful success.   People comment constantly on how happy and at peace she is.  She still has  an obviously inborn strong will - no &quot;will breaking&quot; going on  here.  She has her own little personality and we would NEVER do anything to  threaten that.

This book suggests that you can safely impose a schedule upon your baby.  So, for those readers whose babies &quot;go with the flow&quot;, the advice seems perfectly fine.  However, I disagree that you can generalize this  sort of approach.  Sure, there are babies out there who can function, even  thrive, on scheduled feedings.  There are babies who can sleep through the  night at an early age.  There are babies who are adaptable and cheerful.   These, I believe, are each baby's inborn abilities and personality traits,  NOT something each baby has learned from some method being imposed, however  &quot;modified to suit the parents' gut feelings&quot;.  After three kids,  each of whom had different feeding, sleeping and comforting needs, and each  of whom just naturally fell into some sort of agreeable schedule that  suited their own personality (and didn't always suit mine!), I feel  confident in saying that people who believe the advice in this book is  responsible for their children's thriving and easy-going approach to life  are kidding themselves.  These parents are purely lucky, not clever.   <br />And I agree completely with the serious concern that parents, especially  new ones, might risk their baby's physical and emotional health by  following this advice with a child to whom it is not suited.  In the end,  it feels like an excuse for condoning the methods of parents who aren't  willing to put in the time and effort in meeting their child's needs (this  from someone who has had two highly needy babies and one &quot;easy,  schedulable&quot; baby.)  Of course you're going to be tired and frustrated  in those early (and maybe not-so-early) weeks.  That's part of parenthood.   But as adults, we hopefully can see that the day-to-day difficulties are  more than outweighed by the joy and satisfaction of raising a child,  meeting their needs as THEY convey them to US, not vice versa.  Please just  listen to your baby, not the advice in this book.  All it is giving you is  permission to be less of a parent than you ought to be.	1999-07-11	4

The physical effects do not take into account  the profound emotional damage caused by infants who are being taught that  their needs will not be met by their parents as they cry from hunger during  growth spurts.<br />CHICAGO - Recent media reports have focused on the issue  of whether scheduled feedings or demand         feedings are best for  babies. In response to these reports, the American Academy of Pediatrics  (AAP)         reaffirms it's stance that the best feeding schedules are  ones babies design themselves. Scheduled feedings         designed by  parents may put babies at risk for poor weight gain and dehydration. <br />         The AAP has always advocated breastfeeding as the optimal form of  nutrition for infants, and in         December 1997, the AAP issued its  latest recommendations about breastfeeding infants. The policy          statement says, &quot;Newborns should be nursed whenever they show signs of  hunger, such as increased         alertness or activity, mouthing, or  rooting. Crying is a late indicator of hunger. Newborns should be nursed          approximately eight to 12 times every 24 hours until satiety ... In  the early weeks after birth,         nondemanding babies should be aroused  to feed if 4 hours have elapsed since the last nuring.&quot;	1999-06-14	4

My wife and I  used the basic premises in this book, adjusted according to gut instinct  and common sense, and our daughter sleeps like a champ.  Everything the  book said would happen has happened.  She started sleeping through the  night at 7 weeks;  she doesn't cry when she wakes up -- she  &quot;plays&quot; in the crib;  she is always cheerful when she is awake.   She has slept through the night (knock on wood) for 3 straight months.  I  highly recommend this book.  Do not be deterred by the criticisms -- read  it yourself, adjust it to fit your values and goals, and use it.   (Incidentally, there has been some ciriticism that Ezzo is a religious  zealot.  My wife and I are not particularly religious, and have not found  the book at all &quot;preachy.&quot;  It is about sleep, not religion).

I bought the book  while pregnant after seeing the results of friends who had a rough time at  the beginning with their babies, but then saw amazing results within 10  weeks. I believe that people who are so opposed to this book think that you  must follow it exactly.  You should go with what is comfortable for you.   I, as most of my relatives and friends all used this book as guideline, but  also had their own way of doing certain things.  You must go with your gut  feeling, because every child and family is different.  The main negative  comment I have is that the book basically assumes that all mothers can and  will breastfeed.  At times it was difficult to make the bottlefeeding  connection with all of the suggestions.  However, at week 8 my son starting  sleeping, napping, and eating on a schedule just as the book suggests.

I did not read this book for parenting suggestions, I read it to see what the buzz was about, why people are either for or against this book.  And now I know.   Any book that offers a quick fix--especially in the parenting arena--is  going to be received this way.  This is because every parent, at some point  or another, is going to find life with a baby--a child of any  age--difficult.  Parenting is an endeavour fraught with emotional upheaval  and often we turn to &quot;experts&quot; for help, advice, and support.   The consequent legion of parenting books has replaced our human community,  our village.  Some books--BabyWise being one of them--seek not only to fill  the gap left by this cohesive group of human beings but to replace the  parent as well. Bottom line, children are not for training.  They are for  loving.  Children should be seen and heard.  Children's needs should be  met.  For if their cries bring no response--or not the response necessary  to assuage fear, hunger, discomfort--the child will grow with a  considerable gap in his/her ability to empathize.  The child will quickly  learn that his/her needs are not valid.  The child will learn denial, not  truth.  Sure, the same child may very well sleep &quot;10 hours a night  with 2 or 3 naps during the day.&quot;  What else is there to do if one  feels even the slightest lack of love at such a tender age? Had we chosen  this &quot;method&quot; for our daughter we would have lost her.  She had a  specific MEDICAL problem that was not adequately diagnosed for over a month  after she was born--and during that time she STOPPED BREATHING and turned  BLUE more times than I can possibly remember.  Thank God she was always  with me.  Thank God for family bed.  Thank God I trusted my instincts over  the misinformed words of a certain Gary Ezzo.  God is not in his disjointed  words, He is in my heart.  And because of this my daughter is still with  us, nowa happy, independent, loving, and empathetic two and a half year  old.	1999-05-02	4

If you read with a closed mind or with presuppositions, you may get the idea that parents who  use these methods are self-centered.  On the contrary, any parent who wants  to show their child how much they love them can find a means to do so in  this book.  Using the book doesn't mean it will be easy, but it will be  better.  Most of all, keep in mind to be flexible.	1999-04-19	4

Our daughter woke up nightly for nearly 2 1/2 yrs, yet we were never sleep deprived. Instead we used the night as a time to meet her needs for  closeness and nurturing. If you don't want to parent your child, don't have  one. <br />We respect our child as a human being.  If your spouse was crying  out to you unable to use words because of a disability would you walk away  telling them that they needed to learn to comfort themselves?!<br />It scares  me that this book is presented to well meaning parents as the only way to  bring up a child and they follow it -- going against their own heart and  mind -- because the Ezzos tell them if they don't then they don't really  love their child.<br />Please don't let new parents near this book.

I am a nursing mother and a biologist and find that the book makes very good sense, and it works, and I have the happiest baby in the world.  Of course you need to pay attention the the individual needs of your baby!   And of course a schedule, as the book points out, needs to be flexible!   But the overriding philosophy is that the baby integrates into your  household, into a secure and loving pattern, rather than setting up a  pattern of needing to cry for food.  Babies that abide by this method, in  my experience, are very secure, happily go to bed at night and DO NOT CRY  much at all.  Our little one is 3 now, and the best sleeper I know (with  the possible exception of my sisters baby, who is also a Baby Wise kid).  I  think that people get a misconception that babies will be crying and  demanding but not receiving nourishment.  Nothing is farther from the  truth!  Babies are happy to be put into a routine--wouldn't you like to  know when your next meal is going to come, rather than shouldering the  responsibility of communicating hunger when you can't talk yet?  And if  your baby seems hungry before the next feeding, by all means adjust the  schedule...the book talks alot about flexibility.  I can't say enough good  things about this book.  Try it and see for yourself.	1999-03-23	4

Dear Parents, You may be frustrated, sleep deprived and seeking help, but the advice here may be dangerous to your baby's well-being.  BEWARE!!  Following a set schedule may cause you to ignore your baby's needs,  underfeed and under-comfort him or her.  We know a couple who used this  book and the baby suffered failure to thrive and nearly was hospitalized.   The American Academy of Pediatrics has cautioned against the use of this  book and considers it dangerous.  My pediatrician says it should be pulled  from the shelves.   Some babies can go longer times between feedings, some  babies can become &quot;self-soothers&quot;  but not most.  If you require  this of your baby, you will be teaching it that its needs won't be met and  the world is a threatening place.

Granted, our baby is no doubt very easy, but  under this program, she started sleeping from 9pm to 5am at about 10 weeks,  and waking up happy and alert.<br />Ezzo's book probably achieves good results  if you stick with it, but the difference between the two, as far as I'm  concerned, is that Weissbluth's book is relatively easy to  implement.<br />They both take a tough stand on going to sleep when sleep is  needed, which can be hard.  What's different is their criteria for telling  when sleep is needed.  Weissbluth's seems much more common sense to me, and  much less &quot;extreem&quot;.	1999-02-14	4

BabyWise is a guideline that we based our newborn son's routine around.  Not having any experience as a parent, this book gave us the basis for learning how to meet our son's needs.  This book was recommended by a  family member who has a happy healthy 5 year old daughter.  Our son is now  2 1/2 and is on the same track as his cousin.  Both children are bright,  happy and healthy.  This book was not used by either of us as a strict  method but rather as a guideline to help us all to adjust to the new  changes our lives had taken.  Not once did we let our child &quot;cry it  out&quot; for more than 10-15 minutes.  If the cry was anything more than  just a &quot;I don't want to sleep now&quot; cry, we certainly did what was  necessary to make him happy again.  The best way to use this book is in  conjunction with other theories as well as, and most importantly, with your  common sense and your comfort zone.  I was shocked to hear that so many  people have found this book to be &quot;dangerous&quot;...I truly encourage  any new, experienced, or frustrated parent to pick up this book, it may  give you new insight into your parenting skills.  I recommend it to any  parent that I meet and have actually lost track of my copy since I have  loaned it to so many parents.  I have never heard a bad review until I went  online to order a book for a friend who is expecting.

After actually putting it to work I was highly disappointed.  It leaves too many questions unanswered, like what if during  your childs &quot;sleep&quot; time, it doesn't sleep and just cries it's  way through it, are you supposed to move on to the next scheduled  eat/awake/sleep schedule or let it sleep? It is also geared for breastfed  infants and gives very little direction for formula/bottle fed ones.   Lastly, I totally disagree with how the authors tell you to let your child  basically scream itself to sleep.  All that does is leave both you and the  child exhausted and your nerves are shot.  Crying is one thing, screaming  is another.  I tried the Babywise way for 1 week and after being even more  frustrated than when I began I threw it away and guess what? My son put  himself on his own 4 hour schedule the next day and started sleeping  through the day after that (10 hours at a time at 8 weeks old). He does cry  at times, but it's mostly a tired cry and if he doesn't stop after 5  minutes I reassure him, pat him on the back and leave again, I ususally  never have to do this more than twice. My advice is to go with your own  instincts because babies will eventually sleep on their own.	1999-01-03	4

I believe that parents should review several books regarding child rearing and feeding and choose a philosophy that best suits their personality.  I thoroughly enjoyed Gary Ezzo's book.  It helped me to establish a routine  for my baby yet provided me with the flexibility that I needed.  My  daughter is eleven weeks old and sleeps 9 hours at night.  She is obviously  happy as she smiles and coos throughout the day.  She almost never fusses  or cries and if she does I know that she has a legitimate need.  I am a  person that craves structure in my own life so the information provided in  this book is very pratical for me.  I was not comfortable with demand  feeding because I found it difficult to plan my day.  I never knew when my  daughter would want to eat or sleep.  I try to keep my daughter on a fairly  consistent schedule but she is able to adjust easily when flexibility in  our day is needed.  Baby Wise promotes flexibility not rigidity as many  reviewers have reported.  Read it yourself and decide if it suits your  personality.  Choose which philosophy meets your needs.  Happy parents mean  happy children.	1998-12-31	4

In some places it seems to suggest one thing and in another it seems to suggest the opposite.  The author's tone bothered me, too.  At one point he describes his crying  grandchild: &quot;she would climb rapidly from a whimper to a wail, like an  F-16 heading to the stratosphere&quot;.  He tells us that for his other  grandchild, crying &quot;became an art form&quot;.  In both cases the point  he made was it was unnecessary to attend to the baby, because the cry was  (in his opinion) just basically noise (or art, I guess).  I have read many  books on parenting and never heard a parenting author write in such a  detached way about a baby's cries.  He seems to be quite compassionate  about adults needing their sleep, and about men getting their wives  attention away from the baby, but there is very little compassion and  understanding directed at the little F-16 wailing in the crib.  There are  many, many other wonderful and insightful books on parenting babies.  Buy  one of them.	1998-12-13	4

A best friend gave this book to me at a baby shower and said, &quot;If you don't read anything else as new parents, read this book.  It's a godsend!&quot;  And she was right.  By 6 weeks, our son was sleeping 5 to 6  hours before a 3:00 a.m. feeding, and since 10 weeks, has been sleeping 10  to 11 hours a night with no feedings or changes.  He's such a happy baby,  and craves his routine already at 4 months.  These successes didn't happen  overnight, by any means.  When folks compliment us on our baby's extremely  happy demeanor, I credit Babywise and our hard work.  When asked if our  baby sleeps through the night, and I say yes, for 10 to 11 hours, I hear  &quot;Oh, you're so lucky.&quot;  I assure them luck had nothing at all to  do with it.  Instead, there were nights of holding hands with my husband  and listening to our baby get through those awake times on his own to learn  to put himself back to sleep, all the while trying to convince ourselves  that we, as loving parents, were doing the right thing.  Yes, yes, a  thousand times yes, we were doing the right thing!  Our son now puts  himself to sleep easily, naps regularly, and mommy and daddy can leave him  with a sitter knowing he'll pretty much not be a problem at all.  And a  fairly strict routine has made our lives so much more predictable.  Now,  when our son does fuss, which isn't very often, we know that there's a very  valid reason and something is truly wrong.  No, our son and our lives are  far from perfect, but we feel much more secure as new parents thanks to the   guidance in Babywise.  I always recommend Babywise to anyone I come in  contact with who wonders how they'll ever get their baby to sleep through  the night, because it works.   Now, I'm off to order Babywise II.	1998-12-04	4

Babies don't need to be  &quot;trained&quot; they need to be loved. Ezzo thinks parents should force  schedules on tiny babies. In other books he also recommends hurting babies  as young as 6 months old for &quot;playing with their food&quot;.	1998-11-25	4

He was  high-need and simply could not fit into a 3-hour schedule and sleep through the night as an infant.  I left him to cry  several times, which went totally against my natural mothering instincts,  and it never worked anyway--it only left us both crying and sleep-deprived,  and made for one very guilty mom.  By the time my next baby came along I  had heard about Dr. William Sears and he convinced me that following my  instincts is the right thing to do.  We now practice co-sleeping and I  breastfeed my daughter to sleep whenever she needs it.  What in the world  is wrong with that???  I now get my sleep and my baby daughter is happy and  secure.  Ezzo makes parenthood sound like an unpleasant chore that you find  yourself stuck with.  By contrast, parenting a child is a great  responsibility that takes lots of time, commitment, and love.  If you want  a helpful parenting book written by someone who obviously cares about  children, buy THE BABY BOOK by Dr. Sears--don't waste your money on this  one.	1998-11-13	4

I knew what wonders it  worked in her own life and was eager to read it.  I loved everything it had  to say!  It showed how to really pay attention to what your child's needs  are.  My baby is 7-months old and is so content and happy! Everywhere we  go, we always hear about what a wonderful baby we have and how we are so  lucky.  Well, it wasn't all luck.

With three graduate degrees between us, my husband and I thought we'd figure out new parenthood the same way we figured out everything -- advice of the experts combined with instinct.  As we entered month three of  parenting with our baby not sleeping ONE HOUR at night (up EVERY night from  7 p.m. to 5 a.m.) and us rotating sleep on three-hour shifts, we were  absolutely despondent.  We frantically searched all of our books -- by  pediatricians, lactation nurses, etc.  -- and I can't tell you how many  times we read &quot;baby knows best.&quot;  So, we dutifully fed on demand  (breast feeding 17 times a day at one point) and let the baby set the  schedule -- meaning, there wasn't one.  Enter the Baby Wise book -- within  three days on the Ezzo's schedule, our daughter was sleeping through the  night, and we were beginning to feel human again!  Even though we were  happier, much more importanly our daughter was a new person -- it was if  she needed a schedule even more than we did.  We customized the schedule to  fit our needs, but having guidelines to follow really did save our lives.   I subsequently bought 50 copies of the book, and I hand them out to every  parent I meet who mentions that they are incoherent from sleep deprivation.  An ob/gyn friend also bought dozens of copies to hand out to new mothers --  some of whom were coming in wanting Prozac prescriptions when it turned out  more sleep and a baby schedule was all they needed.  Let's face it -- no  one can function well on two hours of sleep a night for 60 consecutive  nights.   I've had friends whose two and three-year-olds weren't sleeping  through the night, another who hired a night-time sitter because her baby  (now 2!) has never slept through the night (likes to get up and play  between 2 and 4 a.m.).  The Ezzos have the guts to say what current child  experts don't -- namely, that the boundaries set or not set by the parents  determine how life with your child will be.

The principles seem logical, and I expect some  babies adapt very well to schedules, but Baby Wise can be very  UNwise.<br />Baby Wise made me distrust my own instincts.  I was so insecure  as a new mother that I was sure the Ezzo's knew better than me--so if the  two and a half hours hadn't passed and my baby was acting hungry I made him  wait because the authors tell you the baby can be made to wait.  This tore  me apart because all my instincts told me to feed him.  He was getting  adequate food (according to the Ezzo's indicators:  wet, poopy diapers,  etc.), but he was hungry.  After six weeks of torment I began feeding my  baby on demand.  At first he ate every hour,but eventually he established  his own schedule and I learned how to read his signals and trust myself as  a mother.  We were both much happier.<br />If you decide to try this book,  here are some suggestions:<br />1.  If you are insecure about your ability to  sense your baby's needs (i.e. you don't yet trust your intuition), don't  put your baby on the Ezzo schedule until you learn your baby's signals.   I'd suggest demand feeding until you get to know your baby, then, if you  still want to try the schedule thing, go ahead.<br />2.  If you're pretty  rigid and inflexible--a &quot;by the book&quot; type of person, don't buy  this book.  You may wind up (as I did) trusting the schedule more than your  baby or yourself.<br />3.  Most babies establish their own schedule by five or  six weeks anyway (though not all of them will sleep through the night).   But is sleeping through the night the ultimate objective of  parenting?<br />One last comment.  The Ezzo's characterization of demand-fed  babies and their parents is facile, stereotypical, and overly negative.   They assert that parents who demand feed simply offer the breast rather  than investigating the needs of the child.  In fact, their characterization  implies that parents who demand feed are extremely unintelligent and allow  their babies to take over their lives, resulting in a &quot;baby as center  of the universe&quot; scenario.  Creating unrealistic stereotypes like this  is a poor method of argumentation and suggests that the Ezzo's are less  than scientific in their presentation.	1998-10-15	4

As a Child Development professional (I'm a parent of two children, ages 4  mos and 2.5 years), my wife and I found the original Baby Wise to be a  terrific source of parenting advice.  The principles require diligence on  the part of parents (diligence is requirement for any successful parent).  If you love your child (and I'm sure you do!), you owe it to them to be a  loving leader in your home.  This book shows you how to be that loving  leader from day one of your baby's life.  As a Christian, it's interesting  to note that the authors have a series entitled Growing Children God's Way  which explains the biblical principles underlying the secularized Baby Wise  book.  My wife and I used the original edition of Baby Wise, and the areas  we found confusing or thin were, happily enough, the very areas the authors  revised in the current edition.  My firstborn son took four months to sleep  through the nights, but my daughter only 7 weeks!  Oh, and BTW, if you  don't like my credentials as a Child Development professional, my wife's  credentials are better:  she's a licensed clinical social worker with an  MSW in the State of Florida.	1998-10-01	4

I used it, with  some modifications.  I was very nervous at the idea of taking care of a  baby and had no idea what to do.  All the other books that I read talked  about demand feeding, and no sleep, letting the baby run the show, really.   This book gives clear-cut directions, provides schedules for nap time,  playtime, feeding.  I put my son on a 3 hour feeding schedule (as they had  him on at the hospital where I delivered) and it worked fine - at four  months he was 25&quot; long and 20 lbs.  I have heard many criticisms of  this book,mainly regarding babies who were not getting enough to eat based  on the 3 hour schedule.  That can certainly happen, though with all the  charts the book provides for monitoring poop, etc. it seems like you would  catch on to a problem pretty quick.  I think you have to take it like  anything else - I used their guidelines, but I modified it to suit my  family.  My son started sleeping through the night at ten weeks.  I plan on  purchasing Babywise II, now that I've started him on solids and again,  cannot find clear directions on how much to feed and when.	1998-09-30	4

As predicted, they are  contented, happy, secure babies (we continually get comments from others  about how amazing they are) and yes, this helped them (and us!!!) to start  sleeping through the night at 10 weeks -- a major help for parents of  newborns, especially twins (life is wonderful when we're all getting enough  sleep).  And at one year they not only sleep predictably from 8:30pm to 7am  but take good naps in the morning and the afternoon, energizing them and  giving us predictable blocks of time to take care of other things.   <br />Babies are such an incredible blessing.

I was given a copy of Babywise before my daughter was born and it seemed  like a practical approach.  However, when she actually arrived, she was  hungry more than every three hours (and yes, the milk supply was fine) and  an extremely light sleeper.  Had we let her cry herself back to sleep each  time she awakened, we would have been completely exhausted listening to  her.  What this book doesn't mention is that babies go through phases--what  doesn't work in the first few weeks may easily work later.  When she was  about nine weeks old, she suddenly put herself on the three hour  feed/wake/sleep schedule the book recommends.  I am convinced that she just  needed to mature.  She doesn't sleep through the night yet, but even this  book cannot offer guarantees.  Sleeping through the night isn't a standard  by which parenting is judged--it's simply a product of a child's readiness  to do so.	1998-08-27	4

It was a little hard to let him cry at first, but it ended within a few days and he was able to go to bed without being nursed to sleep.  He quit waking in the middle of the night at the same time - so we all got better sleep!  And I was able to figure out when he was truly hungry.  I was so used to giving him my breast everytime he cried, it was wearing me out.<br />Those opponents of this book that have never tried it should not make judgements on those of us who have had success.  For those who've tried it and weren't happy with it - hopefully something else will work for you.  All that really matters - first and foremost is your baby.  As long as s/he is happy then that's what counts.<br />I can honestly say my baby is happy, well adjusted.  I do hold him and cuddle him ! despite what some people think the book implies.

If you follow the Christian (but not scriptural) based ideas of this book, you may see a FTT baby- one who has learned that no matter what s/he signals, her needs will rarely be met.  This applies to feeding, sleep, cuddling, being carried, being talked to.  (Ezzo says we aren't primitive people so our babies don't need a lot of holding or sling/snuggly use.) They also claim there is no &quot;maternal instinct&quot; but they do all they can to obscure the instinct we mothers know we have.  The baby is viewed as a minor inconvenience but a &quot;joy&quot;, (how, they don't explore) whereas the parents are the only truly important family members.  This is the secular version of &quot;Preparation for Parenting&quot; a Christian program, repudiated by many churches.  It doesn't work, and although Ezzo likes to think so, J! esus wasn't raised this way.  Oh, it appears to work, if you want a baby who sleeps, plays and eats on cue, but is unable to determine his or her own bodily needs.  Read the Sears new Christian parenting book instead, or any of their books if you aren't Christian, or Penelope Leach.  (The religious affiliation is not revealed in Becoming Baby(un)wise.)

I received this book for a shower and at first thought it made some sense to establish a routine for a new family, if not a schedule. The carrot dangled in front of new parents is a guarantee of sleeping through the night by 8 weeks. All I accomplished from reading this book was loss: loss of my milk supply and loss of self-esteem. My baby did sleep through the night by 8 weeks, but by that time she had to be supplemented by formula. This book teaches you not to trust your own instincts, that children are demons who need your guidance not to develop into even worse spoiled brats and that babies should be a minor inconvenience in your life. Because I could not stand to let a tiny baby cry, I made Ezzo's &quot;rules&quot; more flexible, but still felt like I had to watch the clock and felt terribly guilty every time I fed the baby 15 minutes early. I later read several criticisms of the method by lactation consultants who said that many babies whose mothers used the system had similar difficulties. I would encourage anyone considering this book to look up Ezzo on the internet and find out how controversial this is and how his own church has denounced his methods. Ask yourself,&quot;How does this man know that God wants me to put my child on a schedule?&quot; My advice, trust your instincts and buy William Sears' The Baby Book, breastfeed on demand and worry about spoiling later. Your baby will sleep through the night soon enough.	1998-06-09	4
